<p class='c009'>The author wishes to acknowledge the courtesy
of Mrs. William Sharpe, who has so kindly
given her permission for the adaptation of parts
of Fiona Macleod’s “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Muime Chroisd</span>” for the
legend of St. Bridget, told here by Johanna.
The author found many fragments of the
legend in the north of Ireland; but nowhere
was it complete as recorded by Fiona Macleod
from the Island of Iona.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>I<br /> <span class='large'>THE CHAPTER BEFORE THE BEGINNING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>I wonder if you know that stories have a
way of beginning themselves? Sometimes
they even do more than this. They tell themselves—beginning
and ending just where they
please—with no consideration at all for the
author or the reader.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps you have discovered this for yourself;
you may have in mind this minute some
of the stories that you wished had begun long
before they did—and others that ended before
you thought they had any business doing so.
These have a very unpleasant way of leaving
your expectations and your interest all agog;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>and I have not a doubt that you have always
blamed the author. This is not fair. In a
matter of this kind an author is just as helpless
as a reader, and there is no use in trying to
coax or scold a story into telling itself her way.
As sure as she tries the story gets sulky or hurt,
picks up its beginning and ending, and trails
away, never to come back; and that story is
lost for all time. You may try it yourself if
you do not believe me.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if I could have had my way, I should
have begun with David in the window nook at
dusk-hour, looking out on the Hill Country all
white with the gathering snow; and I should
have said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was the year after last—and the year
before next—and just seven days before Christmas—”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have begun this way a hundred times, and
every time the same thing happens. The
story behaves disgracefully. It will have none
of my way. I have actually heard it screaming:
“No! I won’t begin there! I won’t—I won’t—I
won’t!” After which it always runs for the
door. As a result I have become completely
cowed and I have given in. I am making believe
now (and so must you, for it never does to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>let a story get in a bad humor) that after all
this is the best beginning.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late fall when David’s world dropped
away from him; at least to David that is what
seemed to happen. When one loses the very
things one always expects to have—big things
like mother and father, home and the boys on
the block—why, there is not so very much of
the world left. To David, speeding toward the
Hill Country on the big express with Johanna,
it seemed as if there was not enough left to
fill even one of the many empty days that lay
before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had all come about because of father being
a scientist. Just what a scientist was David
had never felt quite sure, but he knew it meant
having a great deal of knowledge and very little
time—time for boys. It also meant forgetting
things that even David was supposed to remember;
things like going to bed, and coming
home at dinner-time, and putting on a coat
when it was cold, and rubbers when it rained.
Mother always laughed at these and said that
father was more trouble to look after than
David; and she wondered what she would do
if the time ever came when she would have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>decide between the two of them, and which
needed her most.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, without any warning, that time
had come. Very suddenly father came home
one night and announced that there was a
fresh development of an almost unknown bacillus
among the soldiers in the Eastern war zone;
it was the chance of a lifetime for a scientist,
and he would go as soon as he could pack and
make necessary arrangements. The next moment
he had plunged into his pocket for his
note-book, and only David had seen how
white and still mother had grown. When
she spoke at last there was a funny little
catch in her voice that sounded as if it had
tried to be a laugh, but somehow could not
manage it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hoped and prayed that this wouldn’t happen
quite so soon—this having to decide between
my big boy and my little boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Father had laughed outright. “Nonsense,
there is nothing to decide. Of course you stay
with David. The war country is no place for
either of you, and I shall manage perfectly by
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The war country is no place for David; but
there are plenty of women over there working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>side by side with their husbands. Oh, my
dear, my dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mother’s arms had gathered them both in
and mother was holding them close. It was to
father, however, that she was speaking. “I
believe you are my little boy, after all. Manage!
Over there! When you can’t take care of yourself
in your own civilized country! No, my
dear, you need a mother more than David does.
Besides, there’s Johanna; we’ll send for her.
She will look after David almost as well as I
can; but what would she do with you!” This
time the laugh had right of way and rippled all
over mother’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father had stopped making notes and was
looking at them both with that funny wrinkly
smile about his mouth that David loved to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, what do you think about it?”
he said, looking straight at David.</p>

<p class='c011'>David had squared his shoulders and straightened
his chin; but it took two hard swallows
before he could answer. “I think, sir, that
mother is right. You see I’m eight, going on
nine; and when a—man’s that old he ought to
be able to look after himself for a while. Don’t
you think so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He certainly ought to; but it seems that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>there are some who never are quite able.”
And father’s hand had suddenly reached up to
mother’s, which was about his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>That is all there had been to it. The next
day Johanna had come—good, Irish Johanna,
who had taken care of him as a baby and had
stayed until he had outgrown his need of her
and she had married Barney. The day after,
he had said good-by to the boys on the block;
and he had said it as one about to depart upon
a rare adventure, taking his leave of less fortunate
comrades. He did not intend that they
should discover how much of his world had
dropped away from him, or how he envied them
the continued possession of theirs. Moreover,
it increased his courage threefold to make believe
that what had happened was not so bad,
after all. In this manner he was able to assume
an added stature, one fitting his newly acquired
manhood, when the time came to swing the
door of his home tight shut; and he was
able to say a brave good-by to father and
mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now it was all over. He and Johanna were
speeding toward the Hill Country, and he was
glad, very glad, to be a little boy again and
snuggle into the hollow of Johanna’s arm as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>he had been used to doing in the old nursery
days. After all, eight-going-on-nine is not so
very old.</p>

<p class='c011'>David wasted no time. Out of the scraps
that were left him he tried at once to build up a
new world. He looked out of the car window
at the fields and houses flying past, and he
thought of all the pleasant things Johanna had
promised him. Johanna and Barney were the
caretakers of a big summer hotel in the mountains.
The summer season was over, the hotel
closed, and he was going to live with Johanna
and Barney in the lodge and have a whole
mountain-top to play on. He was going to
help Barney cut down next year’s fire-wood and
drive the sledge for him over the lumber roads.
He was going to make a toboggan-slide down the
cleared side of the mountain; he was going to
skate on the pond above the beaver dam, and
learn to skee, and a crowd of other jolly things.
And in the spring there were to be the maple-trees
to tap. Only, in the mean time, there were
father and mother traveling farther and farther
away; and there was Christmas coming nearer
and nearer. And how could he ever stand one
without the others?</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned away from the car window and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>looked at Johanna; and then out popped the
most surprising question from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hark, laddy! Have ye forgotten all about
the fairies and the stories Johanna used to
tell?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David smiled without knowing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, no. No, I haven’t. A person never
entirely forgets about fairies, even if he does
grow up—does he? I guess I haven’t been
thinking about them lately, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, and ye haven’t!” Johanna’s voice
had the same folksy ring to it that it had in the
nursery days. “Faith, ’tis hard keeping them
lively when ye are living in the city. Wasn’t
I almost giving over believing in them myself,
after living there a few years? It wasn’t till I
moved to the hilltops and the green country
that I got them back again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you seen any up there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David asked it as one might inquire about
the personal habits of Santa Claus or the
chances of finding the crock of gold at the rainbow’s
end, experiences one has never had oneself,
but which one is perfectly willing to credit
to another upon receipt of satisfactory evidence.
Moreover, fairies were undeniably comfortable
to think about just now. And what is more,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>whenever things happen that seem unreal and
that make you feel strange and unreal yourself,
that is the very time that fairies become the
most real and easy to believe in. David discovered
this now, and it made him snuggle
closer to Johanna and repeat his question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you really seen any up there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Johanna puckered her forehead and considered
for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis this way, laddy. I can’t be saying
honestly that I have laid my two eyes on one
for certain; and then again I can’t say honestly
that I haven’t. Many’s the time in the
woods or thereabouts that I’ve had the feeling
I’ve just stumbled on one, just missed him by a
wink, or beaten him there by a second. The
moss by the brookside would have a trodden-down
look and the bracken would be swaying
with no help o’ the wind—for all the world as
if a wee man had just been brushing his way
through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It might have been a squirrel,” suggested
David, the dust of the city still clouding his
mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, but I’m thinking it wasn’t. And if
there’s a fairy up yonder in the Hill Country
I’m thinking ye’ll find him. ’Twill give ye one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>thing more to do, eh, laddy?” Johanna tightened
the arm about him and laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how would fairies get over here? I
shouldn’t think they would ever want to leave
Ireland; and I thought they never came out in
winter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They might come because they had been
locked out.” Johanna’s eyes suddenly began
to dance mysteriously, and she put her lips
close to David’s ear that the noise and jar of the
train might not drown one word of what she
was going to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whist, laddy! Do ye mind what day it is?
’Tis the very last day of the fairy summer, the
last day when they’ll be making the rings and
dancing the reels over in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it’s Hallowe’en,” remembered David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, that’s what! And after this night the
fairies bolt the doors of their raths fast with
magic and never come out again till May Eve,
barring once in a white winter or so when they
come out on Christmas Eve. But it happens
every so often that a fairy gets locked out on
this night. He stays dancing too long, or playing
too many tricks, and when he gets back to
the rath ’tis past cock-crow and the door is
barred against him. Then there’s naught for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>him to do but to bide how and where he can
till opening time comes on May Eve.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if—and if—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, if one should get locked out this night,
what’s to prevent his coming over? What’s
more likely than that he’d be saying to himself,
‘Faith, Ireland’ll be a mortal lonely place with
the rest o’ the lads gone. I’ll try my luck in
another country.’ And with that he follows the
rest of the Irish and emigrates over here. And
if he ever lands, ye mark my word, laddy, he’ll
make straight for the Hill Country! That is,
if he’s not there already ahead of himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Johanna laughed and David laughed with
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, there’s a heap o’ sense in some nonsense,
mind that! And never be so foolish, just
because ye grow up and get a little book knowledge,
as to turn up your nose and mock at the
things ye loved and believed in when ye were a
little lad. Them that do, lose one of the biggest
cures for heartache there is in the world,
mind that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>David turned back to the window. Already,
beyond the foreground of passing woods and
meadows, he could catch glimpses of the Hill
Country, hazy and purple, lying afar off.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Johanna was right. It was better to think of
the locked-out fairy than of himself. He found
himself wondering if fairies grew lonesome as
humans did, and if it was as hard to be locked
out of a rath as a home. He wondered if all
the fairies were grown up or if there were boy
and girl fairies, and father and mother fairies.
He would ask Johanna some time, when he was
sure he could ask it with a perfectly steady
voice. But most of all, he wondered about
opening time; and he wished with all his heart
that he knew just when opening time would
come for him. Until then, he must keep very
busy with the fire-wood and the sled and the
toboggan-slide and the skating and skeeing and
Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>What kind of a Christmas was it going to be?</p>

<p class='c011'>The train climbed half-way to the top of the
highest hill and there it left David and Johanna.
Barney was waiting for them with the horses
and the big wagon to carry them up the rest
of the way; and to David it seemed a very lonesome
way. The stars were out before they
reached the lodge, but even in the starlight he
could see that they were alone on the hilltop
except for the great, shadowy, closed hotel
and the encompassing fir-trees.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Ye’ll not be troubled with noise, and ye’ll
not be pestered with neighbors,” laughed Barney,
as he helped David to clamber down from
the wagon. “Johanna says that in the winter
there is nobody alive in these parts but the
creatures and the ‘heathens’ and ourselves.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>II<br /> <span class='large'>THE LOCKED-OUT FAIRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Two months had passed since David had
come to the Hill Country—two months in
which he had thrown himself with all the stoutness
of heart he could muster into the new life
and the things Johanna had promised. He had
spent long, crisp November days with Barney
in the woods, watching him fell the trees marked
for fire-wood and learning to use his end of a
cross-cut saw. When the snow came and the
lumber roads were packed hard for sledding he
had shared in the driving of the team and the
piling of the logs. He had learned to skee and
to snow-shoe; already he had dulled his skates
on the pond above the beaver dam. Yet in
spite of all these things, in spite of Barney’s
good-natured comradeship and Johanna’s faithful
care and love, the ache in his heart had
grown deeper until his loneliness seemed to
shut him in like the snow-capped hills about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>him. And now it was seven days before Christmas—and
not a word had been said concerning
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>David had begun to wonder if in all that
country of bare hilltops and empty valleys, of
snow and fir-tree and wild creature, there was
anything out of which one could possibly make
a Christmas. And slowly the conviction had
been borne in upon him that there was not.
The very thought of the toy-stores in the city,
of the windows with their displays of Christmas
knickknacks, of the street booths covered with
greens, of what the boys on the block were
doing and talking about, of the memories of all
the other Christmases that had been, brought
unspeakable pangs to his soul. He wondered
how he was ever going to stand it—this Christmas
that was no Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this is how it happened that at dusk-hour,
seven days before Christmas, a very low-spirited
boy of eight—going-on-nine—sat curled
up on the window-seat of the lodge, looking out
through the diamond panes and wishing with
all his heart that he was somebody else in some
other place and that it was some other time of
the year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barney was always bedding down the horses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>at this time and Johanna was getting supper;
and as there was never anything in particular
for David to do it had become a custom with
him to watch for the lighting of the lamps in
the cabins of the “heathen.” There were four
cabins—only one was a cottage; and he could
see them all from the lodge by a mere change of
position or window. Somehow he liked them,
or thought he should like them if he knew them,
in spite of all the unalluring things Johanna had
said about them. According to her the families
who lived in them were outcasts, speaking
strange tongues and worshiping strange gods,
and quite unfit to cross the door-steps of honest
Christian folk. David hardly knew whether
Barney shared this opinion or not. Barney
teased Johanna a good deal and laughed at her
remarks every time she aired her grievance:
that there should be no decent neighbors like
themselves on all that barren hilltop. In his
own heart David clung persistently to the feeling
that he should like them all if he ever got
near enough to make their acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was always the “lunger’s” lamp that shone
out first in the dusk. David could usually tell
to the minute when it would be lighted by
watching the shadow on the foot-hill. Johanna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>was uncertain from what country these neighbors
had come, but she thought it was Portugal.
And Portuguese! Words always failed her when
she tried to convey to David the exact place
that Portuguese held among the heathen; but
he was under the impression that it must be
very near the top. One of these neighbors was
sick with bad lungs, so his family had come to
try the open-air cure of the hills; and they had
been here since early spring. David never saw
their tiny spark of a light spring out against the
dark of the gathering gloom that he did not
make a wish that the “lunger” might be a
good deal better the next day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Across the ridge from the foot-hill lay the
lumber-camp, and here David always looked for
the second light. The camp was temporarily
deserted, the company having decided to wait a
year or two before cutting down any more
timber, and the loggers had been sent to another
camp farther north. Only the cook, an
old negro, had remained behind to guard the
property from fire and poachers, and he it was
that lighted in his shack the solitary lamp that
sent its twinkling greeting up to David every
night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Straight down the hill shone the third light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>from the trapper’s cabin, and it was always
close to dark before that was lighted. What the
trapper’s nationality was Johanna had never
happened to specify; but she had often declared
that he was one of those bad-looking
dark men from the East—Asia, perhaps; and
she had not a doubt that he had come to the
woods to escape the law. David’s mental picture
of him was something quite dreadful; and
yet when his light sprang out of the dark and
twinkled at him up the white slope he always
found himself desperately sorry for the trapper,
alone by himself with the creatures he had
trapped or shot—and his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fourth light came through another window,
shining up from the opposite slope of the
hill—the slope that led toward the station and
the village beyond. This was the flagman’s
light and it hung in the little hut by the junction
where the main railroad crossed the circuit line.
It was always lighted when David looked for it,
and he always sat watching until he should see
the colored signal-lights swing out on the track
beyond, for then he knew the flagman’s work
was over for the day—that is, if all was well on
the road. It happened sometimes, however,
that there was a snow-slide down the ravine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>above the crossing, or sometimes a storm uprooted
a tree and hurled it across the track, and
then the flagman was on guard all night. Now,
the flagman was German; and Johanna’s voice
always took on a particularly forbidding and
contemptuous tone whenever she spoke of him.
David had often marveled at this, for in the
city his father had friends who were German
and they were very good friends. Once David
had spoken his mind:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t see why you call him a heathen,
Johanna, just because he was born in the
country that’s making the war. It wasn’t his
fault—and I don’t see why that’s any reason for
treating him as if he had made the trouble himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, how do ye think we’d be treated if we
were over there now in that heathen’s country?
Sure, ye wouldn’t find them loving us any to
speak of.” Johanna’s lips had curled scornfully.
“Ye can take my word for it, laddy, if
we were there the same as he’s here we would be
counting ourselves lucky to be alive at all, and
not expecting to be asked in for any tea-drinking
parties.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It troubled David, none the less, this strange
unfriendliness of Johanna’s; and this night the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>weight of it hung particularly heavy upon him.
He turned back to his window-nook with a
heart made heavier by this condition of alienage.
No family, no neighbors, no Christmas—it
was a dreary outlook; and he could not picture
a single face or a single hearthside behind
those four lights that blinked at him in such a
friendly fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>He realized suddenly that he was very tired.
Half the day he had spent clearing a space on
the beaver pond big enough for skating; and
clearing off a day’s fall of snow with a shovel
and a broom is hard work. He leaned against
the window niche and pillowed his head on his
arm. He guessed he would go to bed right
after supper. Wouldn’t it be fun now, if he
could wish himself into one of those cabins,
whichever one he chose, and see what was happening
there this minute? If he had found the
locked-out fairy Johanna had talked so much
about he might have learned wishing magic
from him. What had happened to the fairy,
anyway? Of course it was half a tale and half
a joke; nevertheless the locked-out fairy had
continued to seem very real to him through
these two months of isolation, and wherever
he had gone his eye had been always alert for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>some sign of him. Unbelievable as it may seem,
the failure to find him had brought keen disappointment.
David had speculated many
times as to where he might be living, where he
would find his food, how he would keep himself
warm. A fairy’s clothes were very light, according
to Johanna. Undoubtedly he had
come over in just his green jerkin and knee-breeches,
with stockings and slippers to match;
and these were not fit covering for winter
weather like this.</p>

<p class='c011'>David smiled through half-shut eyes. The
fairy might steal a pelt from the trapper’s supply;
that would certainly keep him warm; and
if he were anything of a tailor he could make
himself a cap and a coat in no time. Or, better
yet, he might pick out one that just fitted him
and creep into it without having to make it over;
a mink’s skin would be about the right size, or
a squirrel’s. His smile deepened at his own conceit.
Then something in the dusk outside
caught his eye. Some small creature was hopping
across the snow toward the lodge.</p>

<p class='c011'>David flattened his nose to the window to see
better, and made out very distinctly the pointed
ears, curved back, and long, bushy tail of a
squirrel—a gray squirrel. At once he thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of some nuts in his jacket pocket, nuts left over
from an after-dinner cracking. He dug for
them successfully, and opening the window a
little he dropped them out. Nearer came the
squirrel, fearlessly eager, oblivious of the eyes
that were watching him with growing interest.
He reached the nuts and was nosing them about
for the most appetizing when he sat up suddenly
on his hind legs, clutching the nut of his choice
between his forepaws, and cocking his head as he
did so toward the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>The effect on David was magical. He gave
his eyes one insistent rub and then he opened
the window wider.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come in,” he called, softly. “Please do
come in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>For he had seen under the alert little ears
something quite different from the sharp nose
and whiskers of the every-day squirrel. There
were a pair of blue eyes that winked outrageously
at him, while a round, smooth face
wrinkled into smiles and a mouth knowingly
grinned at him. It was the locked-out fairy
at last!</p>

<p class='c011'>He bobbed his head at David’s invitation,
fastened his little white teeth firmly in the
nut, and scrambled up the bush that grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>just outside. A minute more and he was
through the window and down beside David
on the seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—ee, laddy, where have your eyes been
this fortnight?” he asked. “I’ve whisked about
ye and chattered down at ye from half a score
o’ pine-trees—and ye never saw me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>David colored shamefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind. ’Tis a compliment ye’ve been
paying to my art,” and the fairy cocked his head
and whisked his tail and hopped about in the
most convincing fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>David held his sides and rocked back and
forth with merriment. “It’s perfect,” he
laughed; “simply perfect!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, ’tis fair; but I’ve not mastered the
knack o’ the tail yet. I can swing it grand, but
I can’t curl it up stylish. I can fool the mortals
easy enough, but ye should see the looks the
squirrels give me sometimes when I’m after
trying to show off before them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was nothing but admiration in David’s
look of response. “The coat fits you splendidly,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure—’tis as snug as if it grew on me.
But I miss my pockets, and I’m not liking the
color as well as if it were green.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>David laughed again. “Why, I believe you
are as Irish as Johanna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why shouldn’t I be? Faith, there are
worse faults, I’m thinking. Now tell me,
laddy, what’s ailing ye? Ye’ve been more than
uncommon downhearted lately.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could a wee fairy man be watching ye
for a fortnight, coming and going, and not
know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it’s lonesomeness; lonesomeness and
Christmas.” David owned up to it bravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis easy guessing ye’re lonesome—that’s an
ailment that’s growing chronic on this hillside.
But what’s the matter with Christmas?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There isn’t any. There isn’t going to be
any Christmas!” And having at last given
utterance to his state of mind, David finished
with a sorrowful wail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why isn’t there, then? Tell me that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can’t make Christmas out of miles of
snow and acres of fir-trees. What’s a boy going
to do when there aren’t any stores or things
to buy, or Christmas fixings, or people, and nobody
goes about with secrets or surprises?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fairy pushed back the top of his head and
the gray ears fell off like a fur hood, showing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>fairy’s own tow head beneath. He reached for
his thinking-lock and pulled it vigorously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should say,” he said at last, “that a boy
could do comfortably without them. Sure,
weren’t there Christmases long before there were
toy-shops? No, no, laddy. Christmas lies in
the hearts and memories of good folk, and ye’ll
find it wherever ye can find them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>David shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t see how that can be; but even suppose
it’s true, there aren’t even good folk here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fairy grinned derisively and wagged his
furry paw in the direction of the lights shining
on the hillside:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the meaning of that, and that, and
that? Now I should be calling them good folk,
the same as ye here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” David looked furtively toward the
door that led into the kitchen. “It wouldn’t
do to let Johanna hear you. Why, she thinks—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fairy raised a silencing paw to his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whist, there, laddy! If ye are after wanting
to find Christmas ye’d best begin by passing on
naught but kind sayings. Maybe ye are not
knowing it, but they are the very cairn that
mark the way to Christmas. Now I’ll drive a
bargain with ye. If ye’ll start out and look for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Christmas I’ll agree to help ye find the road to
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” agreed David, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there’s one thing ye must promise me.
To put out of your mind for all time these
notions that ye are bound to find Christmas
hanging with the tinsel balls to the Christmas
tree or tied to the end of a stocking. Ye must
make up your mind to find it with your heart
and not with your fingers and your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” objected David, “how can you have
Christmas without Christmas things?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye can’t. But ye’ve got the wrong idea
entirely about the things. Ye say now that
it’s turkey and plum-cake and the presents ye
give and the presents ye get; and I say ’tis
thinkings and feelings and sayings and rememberings.
I’m not meaning, mind ye, that
there is anything the matter with the first lot,
and there’s many a fine Christmas that has
them in, but they’ll never make a Christmas of
themselves, not in a thousand years. And
what’s more, ye can do grand without them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David rubbed his forehead in abject bewilderment.
It was all very hard to understand;
and as far as he could see the fairy was pointing
out a day that sounded like any ordinary day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>of the year and not at all like Christmas.
But, thanks to Johanna, David had an absolute
faith in the infallibility of fairies. If he said
so it must be true; at least it was worth trying.
So he held out his hand and the fairy laid a
furry paw over the ball of his forefinger in
solemn compact.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a bargain,” David said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is that,” agreed the fairy. “And there’s
nothing now to hinder my going.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He pulled the gray ears over his tow head again
until there was only a small part of fairy left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t ye be forgetting,” he reminded David
as he slipped through the window. “I’ll be on
the watch out for ye the morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David watched him scramble down the bush,
stopping a moment at the bottom to gather up
the remainder of the nuts, which he stuffed away
miraculously somewhere between his cheek and
the fur. Then he raised a furry paw to his ear
in a silent salute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by,” said David, softly, “good-by.
I’m so glad you came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And it seemed to him that he heard from over
the snow the fairy’s good-by in Gaelic, just as
Barney or Johanna might have said it:
“<i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Beanacht leat!</span></i>”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>III<br /> <span class='large'>BARNEY’S TALE OF THE WEE RED CAP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>David watched the locked-out fairy go
forth into the dusk again. He had always
supposed that fairies disappeared suddenly and
mysteriously; but this was not so. The little
gray furry figure hopped slowly across the
patch of white in front of the window, bobbed
and frisked, pricked up the alert little ears, and
swung his bushy tail, after the fashion of any
genuine squirrel, and then dove under the low-hanging
boughs of the nearest evergreens. As
he disappeared, David felt an arm on his shoulder
and turned to blink wonderingly into the
face of big Barney bending over him and
grinning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well, who’d have thought to catch the
sandman making his rounds afore supper!
What sent ye to sleep, laddy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Asleep!” David scoffed hotly at the accusation.
“I was no more asleep than you are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Barney. Why, do you know what I’ve seen,
what’s been right here this very minute?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barney’s grin broadened. “Well, maybe
now it was the locked-out fairy!” For this
was the old joke between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little did Barney dream that this time he had
not only touched upon the real truth, but he
had actually gripped it by the scruff of the neck,
as he would have put it himself. David looked
wise. He was trying to make up his mind just
how best to tell the wonderful news when
Barney’s next words held his tongue and sent
the news scuttling back to his memory.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And speaking o’ fairies, I was just asking
Johanna—getting supper out yonder—did she
mind the tale Old Con, the tinker, used to be
telling back in the Old Country about his great-uncle
Teig and the wee red cap. Did Johanna
ever tell ye, now, about the fairies’ red cap?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David shook his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It serves as an easy way o’ travel for them;
ye might almost call it their private Pullman
car,” Barney chuckled. “Ye wait a minute and
I’ll see is there time to tell the tale myself
atween now and supper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was away to the kitchen and back before
David had much more than time enough to rub
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the gathering frost from the window-pane and
look out for a possible return of his fairy.
Nothing was to be seen, however, but the snow
and the trees and the trail of tiny footprints;
and big Barney was beside him in the window-nook
again, with a mysterious “knowledgeable
look” on his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, there’s time and light enough still in
the west to see the tale through.” He paused
for an instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye know, laddy, over in Ireland they’re
not keeping Christmas the same as ye do here—the
poor, I mean. ’Tis generally the day after,
St. Stephen’s Day, tho’ sometimes ’tis St.
Stephen’s Eve that they manage a bit of a
feast and merrymaking. Them that has little
shares with them that has less; and afterward
the neighbors gather about the turf fire for a
story-telling. Aye, many’s the strange tale ye
will hear over in Ireland on one of them nights.
And here’s the tale Old Con, the tinker, used
for to be telling about his great-uncle Teig—the
most close-fisted man in all of Inneskillen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And here again is the tale as Barney retold
it and David heard it, as he sat in the window-nook
of the lodge at dusk-hour just seven days
before Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>It was the Eve of St. Stephen, and Teig sat
alone by his fire with naught in his cupboard
but a pinch of tea and a bare mixing of meal,
and a heart inside of him as soft and warm as the
ice on the water-bucket outside the door. The
turf was near burnt on the hearth—a handful of
golden cinders left, just; and Teig took to
counting them greedily on his fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s one, two, three, an’ four an’ five,”
he laughed. “Faith, there be more bits o’ real
gold hid undther the loose clay in the corner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the truth; and it was the scraping and
scrooching for the last piece that had left Teig’s
cupboard bare of a Christmas dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gold is betther nor eatin’ an’ dthrinkin’.
An’ if ye have naught to give, there’ll be naught
asked of ye.” And he laughed again.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was thinking of the neighbors, and the
doles of food and piggins of milk that would
pass over their thresholds that night to the
vagabonds and paupers who were sure to come
begging. And on the heels of that thought
followed another: who would be giving old
Shawn his dinner? Shawn lived a stone’s-throw
from Teig, alone, in a wee tumbled-in
cabin; and for a score of years past Teig had
stood on the door-step every Christmas Eve,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and, making a hollow of his two hands, had
called across the road:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey, there, Shawn, will ye come over for a
sup?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Shawn had reached for his crutches,
there being but one leg to him, and had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Faith,” said Teig, trying another laugh,
“Shawn can fast for the once; ’twill be all the
same in a month’s time.” And he fell to thinking
of the gold again.</p>

<p class='c011'>A knock came to the door. Teig pulled himself
down in his chair where the shadow would
cover him, and held his tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Teig, Teig!” It was the Widow O’Donnelly’s
voice. “If ye are there, open your door.
I have not got the pay for the spriggin’ this
month, an’ the childther are needin’ food.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Teig put the leash on his tongue, and
never stirred till he heard the tramp of her feet
going on to the next cabin. Then he saw to it
that the door was tight barred. Another knock
came, and it was a stranger’s voice this time:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The other cabins are filled; not one but has
its hearth crowded. Will ye take us in, the two
of us? The wind bites mortal sharp; not a
morsel o’ food have we tasted this day. Masther,
will ye take us in?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>But Teig sat on, a-holding his tongue; and
the tramp of the strangers’ feet passed down
the road. Others took their place—small feet,
running. It was the miller’s wee Cassie, and
she called out as she went by:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old Shawn’s watchin’ for ye. Ye’ll not be
forgettin’ him, will ye, Teig?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the child broke into a song, sweet
and clear, as she passed down the road:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Listen all ye, ’tis the Feast o’ St. Stephen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.</div>
      <div class='line'>Open your door and greet ye the stranger,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.</div>
      <div class='line in36'>Mhuire as truagh!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Feed ye the hungry and rest ye the weary,</div>
      <div class='line'>This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis well that ye mind—ye who sit by the fire—</div>
      <div class='line'>That the Lord He was born in a dark and cold byre.</div>
      <div class='line in36'>Mhuire as truagh!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Teig put his fingers deep in his ears. “A
million murdthering curses on them that won’t
let me be! Can’t a man try to keep what is his
without bein’ pesthered by them that has only
idled and wasted their days?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the strange thing happened: hundreds
and hundreds of wee lights began dancing
outside the window, making the room bright;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the hands of the clock began chasing each other
round the dial, and the bolt of the door drew
itself out. Slowly, without a creak or a cringe,
the door opened, and in there trooped a crowd
of the Good People. Their wee green cloaks
were folded close about them, and each carried
a rush-candle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Teig was filled with a great wonderment,
entirely, when he saw the fairies, but when they
saw him they laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are takin’ the loan o’ your cabin this
night, Teig,” said they. “Ye are the only man
hereabouts with an empty hearth, an’ we’re
needin’ one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Without saying more, they bustled about the
room making ready. They lengthened out the
table and spread and set it; more of the Good
People trooped in, bringing stools and food and
drink. The pipers came last, and they sat
themselves around the chimneypiece a-blowing
their chanters and trying the drones. The
feasting began and the pipers played, and never
had Teig seen such a sight in his life. Suddenly
a wee man sang out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Clip, clap, clip, clap, I wish I had my wee
red cap!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And out of the air there tumbled the neatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>cap Teig had ever laid his two eyes on. The
wee man clapped it on his head, crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I was in Spain!” And—whist!—up
the chimney he went, and away out of sight!</p>

<p class='c011'>It happened just as I am telling it. Another
wee man called for his cap, and away he went
after the first. And then another and another
until the room was empty and Teig sat alone
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By my soul,” said Teig, “I’d like to thravel
like that myself! It’s a grand savin’ of tickets
an’ baggage; an’ ye get to a place before ye’ve
had time to change your mind. Faith, there
is no harm done if I thry it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he sang the fairies’ rhyme and out of the
air dropped a wee cap for him. For a moment
the wonder had him, but the next he was clapping
the cap on his head, crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spain!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then—whist!—up the chimney he went after
the fairies, and before he had time to let out his
breath he was standing in the middle of Spain,
and strangeness all about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was in a great city. The doorways of the
houses were hung with flowers and the air was
warm and sweet with the smell of them.
Torches burned along the streets, sweetmeat-sellers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>went about crying their wares, and on
the steps of a cathedral crouched a crowd of
beggars.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the meanin’ o’ that?” asked Teig
of one of the fairies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are waiting for those that are hearing
Mass. When they come out they give half of
what they have to those that have nothing, so
that on this night of all the year there shall be
no hunger and no cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then far down the street came the sound
of a child’s voice, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Listen all ye, ’tis the Feast o’ St. Stephen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mind that ye keep it, this holy even.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Curse it!” said Teig. “Can a song fly
afther ye?” And then he heard the fairies cry,
“Holland!” and he cried, “Holland!” too.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one leap he was over France, and another
over Belgium, and with the third he was standing
by long ditches of water frozen fast, and
over them glided hundreds upon hundreds of
lads and maids. Outside each door stood a wee
wooden shoe, empty. Teig saw scores of them
as he looked down the ditch of a street.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the meanin’ o’ those shoes?” he
asked the fairies.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Ye poor lad!” answered the wee man next to
him. “Are ye not knowing anything? This
is the Gift Night of the year, when every man
gives to his neighbor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A child came to the window of one of the
houses, and in her hand was a lighted candle.
She was singing as she put the light down
close to the glass, and Teig caught the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Open your door and greet ye the stranger,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ye mind that the wee Lord had naught but a manger.</div>
      <div class='line in36'>Mhuire as truagh!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis the de’il’s work!” cried Teig, and he set
the red cap more firmly on his head. “I’m for
another country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot be telling you half of the adventures
Teig had that night, nor half the sights that he
saw. But he passed by fields that held sheaves
of grain for the birds, and door-steps that held
bowls of porridge for the wee creatures. He
saw lighted trees, sparkling and heavy with
gifts; and he stood outside the churches and
watched the crowds pass in, bearing gifts to the
Holy Mother and Child.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the fairies straightened their caps and
cried, “Now for the great hall in the King of
England’s palace!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Whist!—and away they went, and Teig after
them; and the first thing he knew he was in
London, not an arm’s-length from the King’s
throne. It was a grander sight than he had seen
in any other country. The hall was filled entirely
with lords and ladies; and the great
doors were open for the poor and the homeless
to come in and warm themselves by the King’s
fire and feast from the King’s table. And many
a hungry soul did the King serve with his own
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those that had anything to give gave it in
return. It might be a bit of music played on a
harp or a pipe, or it might be a dance or a song;
but more often it was a wish, just, for good luck
and safe-keeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>Teig was so taken up with the watching that
he never heard the fairies when they wished
themselves off; moreover, he never saw the wee
girl that was fed and went laughing away. But
he heard a bit of her song as she passed through
the door:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Feed ye the hungry and rest ye the weary,</div>
      <div class='line'>This ye must do for the sake of Our Mary.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Then the anger had Teig. “I’ll stop your
pestherin’ tongue once an’ for all time!” And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>catching the cap from his head, he threw it after
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner was the cap gone than every soul
in the hall saw him. The next moment they
were about him, catching at his coat and crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is he from? What does he here?
Bring him before the King!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Teig was dragged along by a hundred
hands to the throne where the King sat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was stealing food,” cried one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was stealing the King’s jewels,” cried
another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He looks evil,” cried a third. “Kill him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And in a moment all the voices took it up
and the hall rang with, “Aye, kill him, kill
him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Teig’s legs took to trembling, and fear put the
leash on his tongue; but after a long silence he
managed to whisper:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have done evil to no one, no one!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe,” said the King. “But have ye
done good? Come, tell us, have ye given aught
to any one this night? If ye have, we will
pardon ye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Not a word could Teig say; fear tightened the
leash, for he was knowing full well there was
no good to him that night.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Then ye must die,” said the King. “Will
ye try hanging or beheading?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hanging, please, your Majesty,” said Teig.</p>

<p class='c011'>The guards came rushing up and carried him
off. But as he was crossing the threshold of the
hall a thought sprang at him and held him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your Majesty,” he called after him, “will
ye grant me a last request?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank ye. There’s a wee red cap that I’m
mortal fond of, and I lost it awhile ago; if
I could be hung with it on I would hang a deal
more comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The cap was found and brought to Teig.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Clip, clap, clip, clap, for my wee red cap.
I wish I was home!” he sang.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up and over the heads of the dumfounded
guard he flew, and—whist!—and away out of
sight. When he opened his eyes again he was
sitting close by his own hearth, with the fire
burnt low. The hands of the clock were still,
the bolt was fixed firm in the door. The fairies’
lights were gone, and the only bright thing was
the candle burning in old Shawn’s cabin across
the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>A running of feet sounded outside, and then
the snatch of a song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“’Tis well that ye mind, ye who sit by the fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the Lord He was born in a dark and cold byre.</div>
      <div class='line in32'>Mhuire as truagh!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Wait ye, whoever ye are!” And Teig was
away to the corner, digging fast at the loose
clay, as the terrier digs at a bone. He filled his
hands full of the shining gold, then hurried to
the door, unbarring it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The miller’s wee Cassie stood there, peering
at him out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take those to the Widow O’Donnelly, do ye
hear? And take the rest to the store. Ye tell
Jamie to bring up all that he has that is eatable
an’ dhrinkable; an’ to the neighbors ye say,
‘Teig’s keepin’ the feast this night.’ Hurry
now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Teig stopped a moment on the threshold until
the tramp of her feet had died away; then he
made a hollow of his two hands and called across
the road:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey, there, Shawn, will ye come over for a
sup?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And hey, there, the two o’ ye, will ye come
out for a sup?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Johanna’s cheery voice bringing David
back from a strange country and stranger happenings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>She stood in the open doorway, a
lighted candle in her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye’d hurry faster if ye knew what I had
outside for supper. What would a wee lad say,
now, to a bit o’ real Irish currant-bread, baked
in the griddle, and a bowl of chicken broth with
dumplings!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>IV<br /> <span class='large'>DAVID GOES SEEKING THE WAY TO CHRISTMAS AND FINDS THE FLAGMAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>All night long the snow fell, and when
David wakened the hilltop was whiter
than ever, if such a thing could be. The tiny
prints in the snow that had marked the trail of
the locked-out fairy were gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment David wondered if he could
have dreamed it all, and then he knew it could
not be just a dream. It must be something
more, to bring such good Christmas news—news
that lasted all through the night and wakened
him with a song in his heart and a gladness that
a new day had come. And what a day it was!
An orange sun was breaking the gray of the
dawn; he could hear the soft push and pound
of Barney’s shovel clearing a pathway from the
door to the road, and he knew he could be off
early on his skees, down the hill to—where he did
not know. But the fairy had promised that if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>he should start out seeking the way to Christmas
he would help him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He dressed quickly to the swinging rhythm
of the reel Johanna was lilting in the kitchen
below; for in a little lodge bedroom on a hilltop,
with the thermometer outside many degrees
below zero, one does not dally in putting
on one’s clothes. He came down to breakfast
for the first time since he had left the old home
without having to pretend anything in the way
of feelings; and he found beside his plate a
letter from father.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Barney, the rascal, brought it back with
him yesterday and carried it about in his
pocket all evening, never thinking of it once,”
Johanna explained, shaking her fist at that
guilty person just coming in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, the two of us were that busy entertaining
fairies last night we hadn’t mind enough
for anything else.” And Barney winked at
David knowingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>David responded absent-mindedly. His
thoughts and fingers were too busy with the
letter to pay much attention to anything else.
Father had little time for boys, as we have already
said, but when he did take time the results
were unquestionably satisfactory; the letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>proved this. It was a wonderful letter, full
of all the most interesting seeings and doings—just
the things a boy loves to hear about—and
yet it was written as any grown-up would write
to another. That was one fine thing about
father. When he did have time for boys he
never looked down upon them as small people
with little wisdom and less understanding; he
always treated them as equals. But it was
what came at the very last of the letter that
brought the joyful smile to David’s lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>Johanna and Barney saw it and smiled to
each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good news, laddy?” Johanna asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s nothing about coming home, but
there’s something about Christmas.” David
consulted the letter again. “Father says he’s
been looking around for some time for just the
right present to send for Christmas, and he’s
just found it. He thinks I’ll like it about the
best of anything, and it ought to get here—unless
the steamers are awfully delayed—on
Christmas day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s grand!” Barney beamed his own
delight over the news. “What do ye think it
might be, now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David shook his head.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“I don’t know—don’t believe I could even
guess. You see, father never bought me a
Christmas present before—he always left
mother to choose. He said she knew more
about such things than he did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then ye can take my word for it, if it’s the
first one he’s ever got ye ’twill be the best ye
ever had.” Barney spoke with conviction,
while Johanna leaned over David’s chair and
put a loving arm about his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s some virtue in losing them ye love
for a bit, after all, if it makes one o’ them think
about ye and Christmas. Sure, there’s nothing
better in life to put by in your memory than
rare thoughts and fine letters. And, I’m mortial
glad, myself, there’s something good coming
to ye, laddy, from over yonder, for many’s the
time Barney and I have been afeared ’twas a
lonesome Christmas ye’d be finding up here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And to the great surprise of every one,
David included, David answered cheerfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe it’s half bad. Maybe
there’s more Christmas round than we know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The orange sun had paled to yellow and
climbed half the length of the tallest pine from
the crest of the hill when David, bundled and
furred, adjusted his skees outside the lodge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>door. Carefully he pushed his way over the
level stretch of new snow, for one never knew
with new snow just how far one might go down
before striking the crust of the old. A few
yards beyond the nearest clump of evergreen
he stopped. From this point the mountain
sloped down on three sides; the fourth carried
over the ridge to the neighboring hill. Here
David could look down on the encircling valley;
and though the snow lay unbroken everywhere
save on the road leading straight down to the
“crossing” and the village beyond, he could
almost vision paths branching out from where he
stood and leading down to the three inhabited
dwellings on the mountain’s side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Which way should he go? Where would he
first strike his trail for Christmas? Would he
follow the road or one of the invisible paths?
He asked this silently at first, and then aloud,
as if there might be some one near by to hear;
and the answer came in the form of a little
gray furry coat, a pair of alert ears and a
long, bushy tail. Yes, David knew in a twinkling
it was the locked-out fairy, come to keep
his promise. He did not come close enough
for David to see the round, roguish face under
the squirrel cap; but he sat up and twitched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>his head in the direction of the road as if he were
saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come along, David, ye couldn’t be wishing
for a braver day to go Christmas-hunting.
Have ye fetched along your holiday fowling-piece
and your ammunition? For ’tis rare
sport, I promise ye, a hundred times better than
hunting your furred or feathered brothers.
Come along!” And away he hopped down the
road toward the crossing.</p>

<p class='c011'>David followed, as you or I would, and never
stopped till the fairy led him straight to the
flagman’s hut and disappeared himself behind
the drifts beyond the track. Without a moment’s
hesitation David turned the knob of the
door and walked in.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hut was a small one-room affair, bare,
but clean. The walls were whitewashed and
held an array of flags and lanterns, maps and
time-tables. An air-tight stove glowed red at
one end of the room, and beside it, with his feet
on the hob, tilted back in his chair, sat the flagman
puffing away at an old meerschaum pipe.
He was plainly surprised to see his visitor. His
feet came back to the floor with a bang, his
pipe came out of his mouth, and he stared at
David incredulously for a full minute. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the ends of his grizzled mustache bristled upward,
his mouth opened and twisted the same
way, while his eyes seemed to drop downward
to meet it, all the time growing bluer and more
friendly. David took the whole effect to be a
smile of welcome and he responded with outstretched
mittened hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good morning, sir. It’s a—it’s a grand day!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The knotted fist of the flagman accepted the
mitten and shook it warmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Vell—vell—it ees the knabelein from the
hilltop come to see old Fritz Grossman. A
child again—it ees goot!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He reached for a little stool, the only other
piece of furniture in the room, and pushed it
toward David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come—take off the greatcoat and seet down.
It ees long since old Fritz has had a child to see
him. In summer they come sometime from the
big hotel, and from the veelage they used to
many come. But now—ach! Now, since the
war, eet ees deefferent. Now I am the enemy—the
German—and here every one hate the
German!”</p>

<p class='c011'>David felt about for something to say and
repeated something he had once heard: “War
makes enemies.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Ach, ja. But here there ees no war. Here
we should all be Americans, and not hate
peebles for the country where they were born.
Gott in Himmel, can there not be one country
kept clean of the hate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The blue eyes suddenly grew wet, and he
blinked them hard and fast to keep the wetness
from spilling over into disgraceful tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tsa! Old Fritz grow more old woman every
day! I not mind but for the children not
coming; and this time here and no little tongues
to beg tales of the Krist Kindlein and the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weihnachtsman</span> from old Fritz.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David drew closer and laid a friendly hand
on the flagman’s knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to hear one—I’d like bully well to
hear one!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The flagman croaked gleefully deep down in
his throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Zo—but first—I know—the knabelein has a
stomach got. All have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He rose stiffly and reached back of the stove
to where hung his own great bear-coat. From
the pocket he brought out a large red apple and
handed it to David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, eat. And you shall hear the tale of
anodder apple, a Chreestmas apple.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The flagman tilted back in his chair again
and replaced his feet upon the hob. David
sat with elbows on knees and ate slowly.
There was no sound but the occasional dropping
of coals in the stove and the soft, deep
guttural of the flagman’s voice. And here is
the story as he told it to David—only the
broken German accent and the dropping coals
are missing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once on a time there lived in Germany a
little clock-maker by the name of Hermann
Joseph. He lived in one little room with a
bench for his work, and a chest for his wood, and
his tools, and a cupboard for dishes, and a
trundle-bed under the bench. Besides these
there was a stool, and that was all—excepting
the clocks. There were hundreds of clocks:
little and big, carved and plain, some with
wooden faces and some with porcelain ones—shelf
clocks, cuckoo clocks, clocks with chimes
and clocks without; and they all hung on the
walls, covering them quite up. In front of his
one little window there was a little shelf, and on
this Hermann put all his best clocks to show the
passers-by. Often they would stop and look
and some one would cry:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“See, Hermann Joseph has made a new clock.
It is finer than any of the rest!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then if it happened that anybody was wanting
a clock he would come in and buy it.</p>

<p class='c011'>I said Hermann was a little clock-maker.
That was because his back was bent and his
legs were crooked, which made him very short
and funny to look at. But there was no kinder
face than his in all the city, and the children
loved him. Whenever a toy was broken or a
doll had lost an arm or a leg or an eye its careless
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">mütterchen</span> would carry it straight to
Hermann’s little shop.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The kindlein needs mending,” she would
say. “Canst thou do it now for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And whatever work Hermann was doing he
would always put it aside to mend the broken
toy or doll, and never a pfennig would he take
for the mending.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go spend it for sweetmeats, or, better still,
put it by till Christmas-time. ’Twill get thee
some happiness then, maybe,” he would always
say.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now it was the custom in that long ago for
those who lived in the city to bring gifts to the
great cathedral on Christmas and lay them
before the Holy Mother and Child. People
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>saved all through the year that they might
have something wonderful to bring on that
day; and there was a saying among them
that when a gift was brought that pleased
the Christ-child more than any other He
would reach down from Mary’s arms and
take it. This was but a saying, of course.
The old Herr Graff, the oldest man in the
city, could not remember that it had ever
really happened; and many there were who
laughed at the very idea. But children often
talked about it, and the poets made beautiful
verses about it; and often when a rich
gift was placed beside the altar the watchers
would whisper among themselves, “Perhaps
now we shall see the miracle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who had no gifts to bring went to the
cathedral just the same on Christmas Eve to see
the gifts of the others and hear the carols and
watch the burning of the waxen tapers. The
little clock-maker was one of these. Often he
was stopped and some one would ask, “How
happens it that you never bring a gift?” Once
the bishop himself questioned him: “Poorer
than thou have brought offerings to the Child.
Where is thy gift?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it was that Hermann had answered:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Wait; some day you shall see. I, too, shall
bring a gift some day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The truth of it was that the little clock-maker
was so busy giving away all the year that
there was never anything left at Christmas-time.
But he had a wonderful idea on which
he was working every minute that he could
spare time from his clocks. It had taken him
years and years; no one knew anything about
it but Trude, his neighbor’s child, and Trude
had grown from a baby into a little housemother,
and still the gift was not finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was to be a clock, the most wonderful and
beautiful clock ever made; and every part of it
had been fashioned with loving care. The case,
the works, the weights, the hands, and the face,
all had taken years of labor. He had spent
years carving the case and hands, years perfecting
the works; and now Hermann saw that
with a little more haste and time he could
finish it for the coming Christmas. He mended
the children’s toys as before, but he gave up
making his regular clocks, so there were fewer
to sell, and often his cupboard was empty and he
went supperless to bed. But that only made
him a little thinner and his face a little kinder;
and meantime the gift clock became more and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>more beautiful. It was fashioned after a rude
stable with rafters, stall, and crib. The Holy
Mother knelt beside the manger in which a tiny
Christ-child lay, while through the open door
the hours came. Three were kings and three
were shepherds and three were soldiers and three
were angels; and when the hours struck, the
figure knelt in adoration before the sleeping
Child, while the silver chimes played the
“Magnificat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou seest,” said the clock-maker to Trude,
“it is not just on Sundays and holidays that
we should remember to worship the Krist
Kindlein and bring Him gifts—but every day,
every hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The days went by like clouds scudding before
a winter wind and the clock was finished at
last. So happy was Hermann with his work
that he put the gift clock on the shelf before the
little window to show the passers-by. There
were crowds looking at it all day long, and many
would whisper, “Do you think this can be the
gift Hermann has spoken of—his offering on
Christmas Eve to the Church?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The day before Christmas came. Hermann
cleaned up his little shop, wound all his clocks,
brushed his clothes, and then went over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>gift clock again to be sure everything was
perfect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will not look meanly beside the other
gifts,” he thought, happily. In fact he was so
happy that he gave away all but one pfennig
to the blind beggar who passed his door; and
then, remembering that he had eaten nothing
since breakfast, he spent that last pfennig for a
Christmas apple to eat with a crust of bread he
had. These he was putting by in the cupboard
to eat after he was dressed, when the door
opened and Trude was standing there crying
softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kindlein—kindlein, what ails thee?” And
he gathered her into his arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis the father. He is hurt, and all the
money that was put by for the tree and sweets
and toys has gone to the Herr Doctor. And
now, how can I tell the children? Already they
have lighted the candle at the window and are
waiting for Kriss Kringle to come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The clock-maker laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, come, little one, all will be well.
Hermann will sell a clock for thee. Some house
in the city must need a clock; and in a wink we
shall have money enough for the tree and the
toys. Go home and sing.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>He buttoned on his greatcoat and, picking out
the best of the old clocks, he went out. He went
first to the rich merchants, but their houses were
full of clocks; then to the journeymen, but they
said his clock was old-fashioned. He even stood
on the corners of the streets and in the square,
crying, “A clock—a good clock for sale,” but
no one paid any attention to him. At last he
gathered up his courage and went to the Herr
Graff himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will your Excellency buy a clock?” he said,
trembling at his own boldness. “I would not
ask, but it is Christmas and I am needing to buy
happiness for some children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Herr Graff smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I will buy a clock, but not that one.
I will pay a thousand gulden for the clock thou
hast had in thy window these four days past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, your Excellency, that is impossible!”
And poor Hermann trembled harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poof! Nothing is impossible. That clock
or none. Get thee home and I will send for it in
half an hour, and pay thee the gulden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The little clock-maker stumbled out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything but that—anything but that!” he
kept mumbling over and over to himself on
his way home. But as he passed the neighbor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>house he saw the children at the window with
their lighted candle and he heard Trude singing.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it happened that the servant who
came from the Herr Graff carried the gift clock
away with him; but the clock-maker would
take but five of the thousand gulden in payment.
And as the servant disappeared up the
street the chimes commenced to ring from the
great cathedral, and the streets suddenly became
noisy with the many people going thither,
bearing their Christmas offerings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have gone empty-handed before,” said the
little clock-maker, sadly. “I can go empty-handed
once again.” And again he buttoned
up his greatcoat.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he turned to shut his cupboard door behind
him his eyes fell on the Christmas apple and an
odd little smile crept into the corners of his
mouth and lighted his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is all I have—my dinner for two days. I
will carry that to the Christ-child. It is better,
after all, than going empty-handed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How full of peace and beauty was the great
cathedral when Hermann entered it! There
were a thousand tapers burning and everywhere
the sweet scent of the Christmas greens—and
the laden altar before the Holy Mother and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Child. There were richer gifts than had been
brought for many years: marvelously wrought
vessels from the greatest silversmiths; cloth of
gold and cloth of silk brought from the East
by the merchants; poets had brought their
songs illuminated on rolls of heavy parchment;
painters had brought their pictures of saints
and the Holy Family; even the King himself
had brought his crown and scepter to lay before
the Child. And after all these offerings came
the little clock-maker, walking slowly down the
long, dim aisle, holding tight to his Christmas
apple.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people saw him and a murmur rose,
hummed a moment indistinctly through the
church and then grew clear and articulate:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shame! See, he is too mean to bring his
clock! He hoards it as a miser hoards his gold.
See what he brings! Shame!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words reached Hermann and he stumbled
on blindly, his head dropped forward on his
breast, his hands groping the way. The distance
seemed interminable. Now he knew he
was past the seats; now his feet touched the
first step, and there were seven to climb to the
altar. Would his feet never reach the top?</p>

<p class='c011'>“One, two, three,” he counted to himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>then tripped and almost fell. “Four, five,
six.” He was nearly there. There was but
one more.</p>

<p class='c011'>The murmur of shame died away and in its
place rose one of wonder and awe. Soon the
words became intelligible:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The miracle! It is the miracle!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The people knelt in the big cathedral; the
bishop raised his hands in prayer. And the
little clock-maker, stumbling to the last step,
looked up through dim eyes and saw the Child
leaning toward him, far down from Mary’s arms,
with hands outstretched to take his gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>That night, back in the kitchen of the lodge
after supper, David told the story again to
Johanna and Barney. And when he had finished
he saw them looking strangely at each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To think,” said Johanna, thoughtfully,
“we’ve been living here for two years and we
never got so much from the old man. And
who’d have thought to find such a tale bundled
up in an old bunch of heathen rags and language
like him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe, now, he’s not a heathen at all,”
laughed Barney.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the others laughed with him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>V<br /> <span class='large'>THE PATHWAY TO UNCLE JOAB AND A NEW SANTA CLAUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>No fresh snow fell through the night, and
when David slipped his feet into the skee
straps at the lodge door next morning he was
rejoiced to find that the snow had packed and
crusted a little since the day before, which
meant better going. Again he made for the
crest of the hill beyond the first clump of
evergreens and again he stood at the pinnacle
of the ways and wondered which he would take.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might count,” he laughed aloud—“I might
count them out.” And with that he fell into
the school-boy doggerel, nearly as old as boyhood
itself: “Eeny—meeny—miny—mo. Catch—a
nigger—by the—”</p>

<p class='c011'>He came to a sudden stop. In the direction
of the lumber-camp, where the evergreens
marked the beginning of the road, he had
caught a glimpse of a gray squirrel. Was it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>real squirrel this time, or was it the locked-out
fairy again? There was not a minute to be lost.
He must find out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the unbroken snow he slid, balancing
himself carefully when he came to the hummocks
made by the wind or fallen trees, his eyes
coming back constantly to the little gray figure
before him. It was sitting erect now, under a
green bough, apparently busy investigating the
contents of a pine cone. But just as David had
made up his mind that this time it was a real
squirrel, up went the furry paw to an ear in
unmistakable salute, just as the locked-out
fairy had done when he hopped from the window-ledge
of the lodge. Then, with ears set
back and tail out straight behind, the squirrel
flew down the hill. Away went David after
him, the tassel of his toboggan-cap out as
straight as the squirrel’s tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never was there such a race. They dodged
trees and fallen branches; they leaped drifts;
they spun like tops around the curves. Sometimes
David was so close upon the fairy’s heels
that he could almost have touched him with the
end of his steering-cane, but the next moment
he generally lost his balance and slipped a skee,
and head over heels he would go in the crusty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>snow. When he righted himself the fairy was
always yards ahead, sitting with his shoulders
all hunched up as if he were laughing silently
at David’s tumble. So exciting was the whole
race that David entirely forgot his destination
until he suddenly found himself almost bumping
a corner of one of the lumber cabins, and the
fairy nowhere in sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped a minute for breath and to wonder
what he would do, when he heard the soft,
silvery notes of a violin. The music was coming
from inside that very cabin, and a voice
was humming softly as well. David moved round
to one of the windows, hoping he might be tall
enough to look in, but the snow had drifted
away from that side and he missed the ledge
by several inches. It occurred to him, however,
that if the snow had drifted from this end it had
probably drifted toward the other. He would
try it, at any rate. Round the cabin he went,
and, sure enough, there the snow had piled up
half-way to the window and David found he
could look in comfortably.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a great fire blazing inside, and by
it sat an old negro with the whitest hair and
beard David had ever seen. A fiddle was
tucked under his chin and slowly and lovingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>he was bowing the melody from it, while one
foot patted the time on the floor and a plaintive,
mellow voice put words to the music. David
listened for the words and caught them:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yeah come-a-No-ah—a-stumblin’ tru de dark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wif hammah an’ wif nails-to-a-build hisself an ark.</div>
      <div class='line'>An’-a-yeah come de an’mals-two-a-by two,</div>
      <div class='line'>De Yippo-ma-pot’mus—an’ de kick-kangaroo.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The bowing suddenly stopped and David was
conscious of a pair of very white eyeballs looking
at him through the glass. For the space of a
breath or more David was not at all sure that he
wanted to get any nearer that strange, bent old
figure. He was almost sure that he did not
want to go inside. Not that he was afraid.
Oh no, indeed! He was not in the least bit
afraid; there was nothing to be afraid of.
Even Johanna had not said anything harmful
about the old cook at the lumber-camp. Nevertheless,
there was something mysterious, something
not altogether inviting about that inky-black
face with the white hair and rolling
eyeballs.</p>

<p class='c011'>David was speedily withdrawing himself,
having decided that there was great virtue in
distance, when he heard the creak of the cabin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>door. In a trice the old negro, fiddle in hand,
appeared around the corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wha you goin’, honey?” There was unmistakable
regret over David’s retreating figure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why—why, I’m just going back where I
came from.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wha you come from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David pointed upward and the old darky
nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Pears to me dat am a long way fer a li’l’
boy to come an’ den turn ’bout an’ go right
home. Come in, honey, an’ Uncle Joab’ll play
you somethin’ lively on de ole fiddle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David hesitated, but only for an instant.
There was something too lonely and appealing
about the man to be denied. David was still not
at all sure that he wanted to go, even while he
was following the lumber cook round to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was surprisingly cozy and cheerful inside,
perhaps because of the open fire, the strips of
pine cones, husked corn, and bunches of colored
berries that decorated the walls and rafters.
Uncle Joab caught David’s wondering, curious
gaze, and he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yas, dat’s pop-corn, honey. An’ I reckon
Uncle Joab’ll have some a-poppin’ for you over
dese yeah coals in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>He mounted stiffly the hewn, polished stump
that did service for a stool and pulled down two
of the ears. From the corner of the fireplace he
brought a corn-popper and, sitting down, he
commenced to shell the corn by rubbing the
ears together. David drew up a chair near by
and watched him with growing interest. When
the corn was shelled Uncle Joab raked away the
unburned wood from the fire, leaving a bed of
the red coals. Over this he held the corn,
shaking the popper gently from side to side.
In less time than it takes for the telling sounded
the snap-snap-snap of the bursting kernels, and
in a moment more Uncle Joab had turned the
snowy contents into an earthen bowl and laid
it on David’s knee with a small dish of salt and
the invitation to “Go ahead.” Then he took up
his fiddle again and played the promised music.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a jig, such a rollicking, care-free jig
that before it was finished David found himself
wondering how in the world he ever hesitated
about coming in. Why, here was nothing but
another boy like himself, a boy grown old before
he had grown up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like dat corn, honey? Wall, you come
along yeah ’round Chris’mus an’ Uncle Joab’ll
make you some m’lasses balls.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>A sigh escaped with the promise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lordy—Chris’mus—yeah! Doan’t seem
like I done hab any Chris’mus sence I left ole
Virginy. Seems like it done froze stiff ’fo’ ever
it got to dese yeah parts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David laughed at the old man’s humor. It
had seemed just that way to him a few days ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t we thaw it out?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twould take a monstrous lot o’ warm
feelin’s, honey, an’ kind folks, I reckon. An’
you’d not find ’em a-hangin’ ’round loose yeah
in de wintah. Why, dere’s no more ’n a han’ful
of us, all measured an’ mixted; an’ as fur as I
know dere’s not one a-speakin’ to another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s not much like Christmas, is it,
Uncle Joab? Not much ‘good-will’ when you
don’t know your neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old darky grunted, then he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Pears to me it’s de critters dat get on yeah
more folksy den de real folks—an’ dat put me
in mind of a story my mammy used to tell me
when I was your size.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David beamed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you tell it, Uncle Joab?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Co’se I’ll tell it, honey.” And putting the
fiddle down beside his chair he began:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“I reckon you think dat de jolly ole saint wif
de red nose an’ de dimple somewhas ’twixt his
mouf an’ his ears only ’members de chillun at
Chris’mus. An’ dat’s not de trouf. Dere was
one Chris’mus long time ago, after Pharoe’s
daughter found Moses in de bull-grass an’ ’fo’
Christoper Columbus went a-sailin’ ’round to

of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In dose days dere warn’t de chilluns dere is
now. Dey warn’t so plentiful an’ dey warn’t
so perticular; an’ each one warn’t lookin’ fer a
whole shed full o’ toys jest fer hisself. No, sir,
honey! He was bustin’ wif tickle if he got one
gif’ an’ some barley sugar. An’ what’s more,
dey wasn’t so pernicity ’bout what dey got.
De dolls didn’t have to walk an’ talk an’ act
like real folks an’ de trains didn’t have to go
by demselves. An’ everything bein’ so comf’able
an’ easy, ole Santy could tote de pack o’
toys ’round hisself on his back an’ be home a
good two hour ’fo’ daylight, wif nothin’ to
do de rest o’ de day but set ’round an’ think.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wall, in dose days, honey, de folks doan’t
pester de critters wif workin’ dem all de time.
No, sir! Dey work dem when dey need dem,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>an’ de balance o’ de time de critters trope
’round free an’ easy-like. Folks wasn’t cotchin’
de cur’ous ones to put in de menageries an’ de
circuses, nor de furry ones to trim up de ladies
wif. Times was pleasant an’ comf’able fer
every one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now it transmigrate one day when ole
Santy was a-settin’ an’ rumminatin’ dat he
fotch up his thoughts on de critters, an’ he says
to hisself, says he:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘’Pears like dey has a right to Chris’mus
same as de folks. Dey minds dere bus’ness, an’
dey works an’ dey plays de same, an’ dey had
dere share in dat fust Chris’mus when de li’l’
Lordie was born—same as de folks. Didn’t de
donkey carry Mary to Beflehem? Didn’t de
mully-cow gib her manger for de li’l’ Lordie to
sleep in? Didn’t de cock crow de news to St.
Stephen? An’ how do yer reckon de Wise Men
could ha’ toted dere presents ’cross de sand if it
hadn’t been fer dem cam’ls?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yas, sir, honey! Ole Santy was right.
De critters had as much right to Chris’mus as
de folks, an’ ole Santy poun’ his knee an’ swear
he gwine to gib dem one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So de ole saint he begun fer to study an’
to study what he gwine to do fer de critters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>He can’t come down dere chimbleys ’ca’se dey
’ain’t got no houses; an’ he can’t fill dere stockin’s
’ca’se dey doan’t wear none; an’ he can’t
fotch dem barley candy ’ca’se dey doan’t eat it.
Wall, he set dere an’ study twell his brain ’mos’
bustin’ an’ bime-by he fotch up wif an idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I know what I’ll do,’ says ole Santy, says
he. ‘Dem critters is sure to be like folks;
dere’s certain to be a lot dat ain’t satisfied wif
dere pussonalities. Now I’m gwine to trim up
a Chris’mus tree wif a lot o’ odd tails, an’ ears,
an’ wings, an’ legs, an’ sech-like, an’ any o’ de
critters dat ain’t satisfied can choose jes’ what
dey want. Dat’s what I’m gwine to do,’ says
ole Santy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wall, thinkin’ was doin’. An’ by de time
Chris’mus come along dat ole saint had de mos’
cur’os, hetromologous collection o’ an’mal parts
you ever done hear tell about. He sent word
by de birds all over de world fer de critters to
come to a Chris’mus celebration at de fust
fir-tree dis side o’ de North Pole. ’Fo’ dey git
dere ole Santy had it all trimmed up wif his
presents; an’ when de critters trope up dey
sure was bustin’ wif s’prize when dey see all de
tails an’ wings an’ legs hangin’ dere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ de an’mals! Bless your heart, honey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>you never see such a camp-meetin’! Dere was
elephants an’ tigers an’ lions an’ yippopot’musses
an’ rabbits an’ ’possums an’ mouses—every
livin’ kind. An’ all de birds dat clip de
air an’ all de fish dat swum de sea. Dey all
come lopin’ up wif dere purtiest manners on;
an’ dey scrape an’ dey bow an’ ax after ole
Missus Santy an’ de chilluns. When dey’d
axed an’ scraped all ’round, ole Santy says, says
he:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Now any o’ you-all critters dat want fer to
change yer pussonalities can jes’ step right up
an’ choose somethin’ new,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everybody was mighty bashful at fust.
Dey all tried to hide behind dere neighbors an’
look like dey was puffectly satisfied wif dere
looks an’ dere habits. But bime-by a squeaky
li’l’ voice calls out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘If you please, Ole Man Santy, I’d like a
pair o’ dem li’l’ brown wings, an’ thank you
mighty much.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Santy look down an’ see it was one o’ de
li’l’ mouses speakin’; an’ he reach up an’ take
from de tree a cunnin’ pair o’ li’l’ wings an’
fastened dem on tight. An’ de next minute dat
sassy li’l’ mouse went flippin’ an’ floppin’ into
de air same as if he’d been born wif wings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>An’ ever since, honey, he an’ his chilluns have
been flyin’ ’stead o’ creepin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did he turn into a bat, Uncle Joab?” David
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure. What else you ’spec’ he could turn
into? Wall, de nex’ to walk up was Bre’r
Rabbit. He had a lot to say ’bout his ears
bein’ so short he couldn’t hear ’nough, an’ his
tail bein’ so long he couldn’t fetch up on it
com’fably in de brier patch. He’d be powerful
pleased if Santy’d gib him bigger ears an’ take
away his tail. Dis made de ole saint chuckle;
an’ he fotch down de biggest pair he can find
an’ put dem on, an’ den he twist off de rabbit’s
long, bushy tail. When de other critters see
what transmigrate dey like to bu’st dere sides
wif laughin’; an’ dis scare Bre’r Rabbit so dat
he lay back his ears so he can’t hear so well,
an’ he lope off to hide his confusi’n in de brier
patch. An’ dere you’ll find him hidin’ to dis
yeah day, honey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And were there any more who weren’t satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t I tell you de critters were like folks?
Bre’r Rabbit hadn’t more ’n cleared de Chris’mus
tree when de squirrel sings out:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“‘If you please, Mr. Santy, I’d like Brudder
Rabbit’s tail. I’d like Brudder Rabbit’s tail.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘’Twon’t fit you,’ says de beaver. ‘It’s
three sizes too big.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘No, it ain’t! No, it ain’t! No, it ain’t!’
An’ de squirrel carry on so scan’lously dat ole
Santy ’bliged to gib him de tail to keep him
quiet. But, bless your heart, honey, you know
as well as I do dat dat tail am no fit for dat
squirrel!</p>

<p class='c011'>“By dis time de critters was nigh over dere
bashfulness, an’ dey was clamorin’ for what dey
wanted. De leopard say his coat too yaller,
an’ he’d like some nice, stylish black spots to
tone it down. Den de zebra say stripes was
more stylish dis year den spots, an’ he’d ’low
he’d like stripes. De elephant say his feet too
big to pick up things handy, an’ he’d like
somethin’ extra to pick up things wif.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dis set de rest o’ de critters to ’sputin’ whar
de elephant have room on his pussonality fer
anythin’ extra; an’ while dey ’sputin’ ole Santy
sit still an’ study. Bime-by he says, says he:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘De only spare room am on de end o’ your
nose. If you want to have it dere, say so!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“De elephant he say so. So Santy take one
o’ dese yeah suckers, left over from a debilfish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>an’ he stick it squar’ in de middle o’ de
elephant’s nose. He stick it so hard, an’ he
stick it so fast, dat it hasn’t come loose dese
thousand o’ years.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wall, dat certainly was a busy Chris’mus
fer de ole saint. He was fixin’ tails an’ legs an’
ears an’ wings ’most all day. De beaver he
gets de sulks ’ca’se de squirrel’s got Bre’r Rabbit’s
tail an’ he want it. De rest o’ de critters
try to coax him to take somethin’ else, but
’pears like he crazy fer somethin’ behind. He
took to moanin’ an’ wailin’ ’ca’se he can’t get
what he wants twell bime-by he nat’rally gets
ole Santy plumb wore out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Look yeah,’ says ole Santy, says he. ‘You’s
so sot on havin’ somethin’ behind, ’pears like I’d
hab to gib you somethin’ diff’rent an’ distinguishin’.’
An’ wif dat de ole saint claps on him
one o’ dem flappers dat he’d made fer de li’l’
seals to walk on. An’ it’s been hangin’ to de
back o’ de beaver ever since.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At las’ all de critters were satisfied ’ceptin’
de dog an’ de horse an’ de reindeer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘What you want?’ says ole Santy to de
dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I want faithfulness,’ says de dog; an’ Santy
gib it to him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“‘What you want?’ he says to de horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I want wisdom,’ says de horse; an’ Santy
whisper it into his ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Now what you want?’ he says last of all to
de reindeer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I want to be your servant an’ lib always wif
you,’ says de reindeer. An’ from dat minute
to dis de reindeer an’ his chilluns have been
totin’ fer ole Santy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ you listen yeah, honey. If you borrow
Bre’r Rabbit’s ears to hear wif dis Chris’mus
p’raps you’ll cotch de tromp o’ de reindeer’s
hoofs an’ de jingle o’ his bells as he totes ole
Santy through de night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David laughed happily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a bully story, Uncle Joab, just a bully
one!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man chuckled appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe it’s good enough to fotch a li’l’ boy
back some other day to see dis ole nigger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Johanna and Barney had to hear the story
over twice before David went to bed that night.
They seemed to like it as much as David had
liked it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must get pretty lonesome for the poor
man, stormy days and long winter nights with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>no company but that old fiddle,” mused Johanna
at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Faith, I wouldn’t be minding a bit o’ that
same company, myself, some night,” laughed
Barney. “’Tis a sorry time since I’ve heard
any good fiddling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But David did not say anything. He was
looking deep into the fire and thinking very
hard.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE LOCKED-OUT FAIRY AGAIN LEADS THE WAY AND DAVID HEARS OF A CHRISTMAS PROMISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>David was already beginning to feel very
rich in Christmas as he climbed to the
crest of the hill the next morning. Yes, the
locked-out fairy was right. Real Christmas lay
in the hearts and memories of people, and he
was sure he was storing up some in his own to
last for always.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was still four days before Christmas, yet
he felt all the warm glow of excitement, all the
eagerness, all the gladness, that usually attended
the very day itself. He was beginning
to think that instead of one Christmas he was
finding a whole week of it, and for a little boy
who had had loneliness fastened to his heels
like a shadow for so long the feeling was very
wonderful. Not that he did not miss father and
mother just the same, but they no longer seemed
so far away. There were minutes when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>could think them quite close, when they seemed
to have a share in all he was doing and thinking,
and when that happens with any one we love
loneliness vanishes like a shadow at midday.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were but two paths left for him that
morning to choose between—the path leading to
the trapper’s and the one to the “lunger’s.”
It was not a particularly cheery day. The sky
was a leaden gray—a hue forecasting snow before
day’s end. The wind was biting and raw,
and had there not been a quest afoot David
would have been glad to stay near home and
share Barney’s cheerful company. As it was,
he had about made up his mind that he should
choose the trapper. He knew as little about
him as he had known of the others, and he
pictured a big, gruff, hairy man something like
his old Grimm illustration of Bluebeard. But
for all that, he seemed more alluring on such
a day than a “lunger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David very much hoped that the locked-out
fairy would be there to take him the way he had
chosen to go. He wanted not only the guidance
of the fairy, but he wished to see him close again
and talk with him. He was looking about for
signs when his eyes swept the snow at his feet
and there he found the trail laid for him. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>far as eye could reach there were the tiny sharp
prints of a squirrel’s foot, and they led, not
down the hillside to the trapper’s hut, but,
straight as a stone drops, to the foot-hill beyond,
where the “lunger’s” cottage stood.</p>

<p class='c011'>David heaved a sigh of disappointment. He
would so much rather have gone the other way;
but of what use is a fairy counselor and guide
if one does not follow his trail? So with something
very near to a flagging courage David
pushed his way slowly after the tiny footprints.</p>

<p class='c011'>He missed the exhilaration of the sunshine
and air and excitement of the previous days.
Somehow he felt this time was going to be a
failure and he shrank from facing it; moreover,
he thought of what he might have to tell
Johanna and Barney afterward, around the
fire. A moment before he had felt so rich in the
feeling of Christmas. And now, was he going
to find an unpleasant memory to take away from
the good ones?</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no sign of life about the little cottage
on the foot-hill. The sleeping-porch was
deserted, the windows were heavily curtained,
the snow was piled up high and unbroken about
the door; even the roadway beyond, which led
down the other side to the village, was smooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and crusted, showing that no one had come
or gone from the house since the last fall of
snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It looks awfully gloomy and deserted,”
thought David. “The ‘lunger’ must have
gone away or died!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last was a dreadfully dreary thought, and
it almost turned David’s feet on the very
threshold, in spite of the fairy’s trail. But the
memory of the day before held him back. How
nearly he had come to losing a bit of Christmas
just because an old white-haired negro had
looked at him suddenly through a window! He
would mark himself as a quitter and a “’fraid-cat”
for all time if he ever let such a thing happen
again. And what would the boys on the
block think of him?</p>

<p class='c011'>With heroic boldness David pushed his skees
up to the baseboard of the door and hammered
hard on the brass knocker. Once, twice, three
times he knocked. Then he heard soft feet inside
and the turning of the key in the lock. In
another minute the door opened, letting in a
generous fall of snow and disclosing a tall, oldish
woman in black, with very black hair and big,
sorrowful black eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madre de Dios!” she exclaimed in a soft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>voice full of surprised wonder. “A <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">niño</span>—here,
in this freeze country!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please,” began David, politely, “I
came—I came—”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he did not finish. For the life of him he
could not have told just why he had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Entre, come!” And the woman drew him
in and closed the door behind him. “A boy!
It may be that it will put again the heart in
Alfredo to see a boy. Come, chico!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She opened another door at the end of a hall
and led him into a bare, cold, cheerless room.
Half a dozen black bentwood chairs stood with
backs against the walls; the two rockers of the
same faced each other at opposite sides of the
fireplace; and between them stretched a cot
covered with heavy blankets. A half-hearted
fire burned on the hearth, and watching it listlessly
from the cot lay a boy about twice his
age, David thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See, Alfredo! See chicito mio, who come
here,” the woman called. And the sick youth
turned his head slowly to look at them.</p>

<p class='c011'>David saw a thin, colorless face with great,
black eyes. They had the same look that was
in the woman’s eyes, only the woman did not
look sick, only sad. As the boy saw David he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>smiled in a pleased, surprised way, and held
out a thin, white hand in welcome. But the
hand was so thin David was almost ashamed to
put out his own broad, brown little fist to take
it. He compromised by leaving on his mitten—and
he shook it very gently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, it is good,” said the boy, simply. “I
am glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” David beamed. He was glad
he had come. For here there were things that
he could do, and first of all he’d tackle the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s this way,” he explained as he slipped
out of his outside things. “I’m spending the
winter up on the hill, in the hotel lodge. It’s
been getting sort of lonesome there lately
since winter set in, so I thought—I—it seemed
sort of nice to come around and look up some
of the neighbors.” David finished out of
breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alfredo and his mother exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is good,” said the boy at last. “You
are the first one, and we, too, have been what
you call ‘lonesome.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m awfully sorry.” And this time David
held out the unmittened fist. “Say, do you
mind if I build up that fire a little? It looks
sort of—sick.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Ah!” The woman held up protesting
hands. “Alfredo is too sick but to lie still.
And I—what do I know about building fires in
open places with wood? It is only the carbon
I know, and the shut stove. And when our
servant leave us three—four day ago and no
one ever comes near to us I think then that we
die of the cold before long time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tears of utter despair showed in the woman’s
eyes; and David found his own growing sympathetically
moist.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no! Barney wouldn’t let that happen—not
to any one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It really was dreadful to find a sick boy and a
woman alone—strangers in this country—with
the cold and the loneliness to fight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you tell me where the wood is, and
I’ll have a cracker-jack fire in a minute. Barney’s
showed me how. I can make ’em burn
even when the wood’s damp.” David did not
finish without a tinge of pride in his tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made several trips to the little back room
beyond the kitchen which served as woodshed,
and in a few minutes he had a generous
stack of logs and kindlings beside the hearth
and a roaring fire blazing up the big chimney.
The glow and warmth lit up Alfredo’s cheeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and kindled a new life in the woman’s eyes.
Such a little thing it takes sometimes to put the
hearts back in people.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, if you want me to, I’ll just fill up the
kitchen stove and the one in the hall. It’s
really too cold here for any one,” he ended,
apologetically.</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman accepted his offer, mutely grateful;
and when both stoves had finally responded
to his coaxings and were cheerfully crackling
and sending out the much-needed heat, David
came back to the open fire and drew up one
of the rockers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a good <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">niño</span>, eh, Alfredito?” said the
woman, softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>David wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say—I’ll tell you about the flagman, and
Uncle Joab at the lumber-camp. Want me
to?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The offer was made as a cloak to his embarrassment;
but the next moment, as he launched
into his narrative of the two previous days, he
had forgotten everything but the tales he had to
tell and the interest of his listeners.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he had finished, David was surprised
to see the change in the faces of the two. For
the first time they seemed really alive and warm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>inside and out. Moreover, they looked happy,
strangely happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We had almost forgot, chico mio,” the
mother said, stroking one of the thin, white
hands, “that comes now the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Natividad</span>. Ah,
who would think to find it here in this freeze
country!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are South-Americans,” the boy explained.
“And down there it is summer now,
with the oranges ripe, and the piña growing and
the air full of the sweetness from the coffee-fields
in bloom and the jasmine and mariposa.
We did not know such cold could be—or so
much snow. Eh, madre?” And the boy
smiled wanly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how did you come way up here from
your country? Was it the—” David left the
question unfinished.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy nodded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I came first, to be in one of your fine
universities. Many South-Americans come
here for their education. But before many
months I take the cough, and it is then no use
to go back to our country. We blow out there
like a candle in the wind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mother went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the great American doctor say here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>there is a chance in the mountains, if he can
stand the winter. And oh, at first he grow
much better! We see the good health coming.
But now, the great cold, the heart-hunger, the
alone being, it seem to take his strength. I
fear—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, madre! This is not good cheer for a
guest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David felt his cheeks burn with the sudden
tenderness in the boy’s look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, madre,” he went on, “have we not
also a tale of Christmas, of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Natividad</span>, to
give away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is that one I have told you a thousand
times—the one my mother told me when I
was a niña, home in Spain. The tale of the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tres Reys</span> and the Christmas promise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy sighed happily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no better tale in all Spain. Tell it,
madre, to our friend here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so this was how the third bit of Christmas
came to David, by way of a locked-out fairy, a
rekindled fire, and a stranger from the far South.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Christ-child was born in Bethlehem
of Judea, long years ago, three kings rode out
of the East on their camels, bearing gifts to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Him. They followed the star until at last they
came to the manger where He lay, a little, new-born
baby. Kneeling down, they put their
gifts beside him: gold, frankincense, and
myrrh; they kissed the hem of the little white
mantle that He wore, and blessed Him. Then
the kings rode away to the East again, but
before ever they went they whispered a promise
to the Christ-child.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the promise? You shall hear it as the
kings gave it to the Christ-child, long years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As long as there be children on the earth,
on every Christmas Eve we three kings shall
ride on camels, even as we rode to Thee this
night; and even as we bore Thee gifts so shall
we bear gifts to every child in memory of Thee—thou
holy Babe of Bethlehem!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Spain they have remembered what the
Christmas kings promised, and when Christmas
Eve comes each child puts his <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">sapatico</span>—his
little shoe—between the gratings of the window
that they may know a child is in that house
and leave a gift.</p>

<p class='c011'>Often the shoe is filled with grass for the
camels, and a plate of dates and figs is left beside
it, for the children know the kings have
far to go and may be hungry.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>At day’s end bands of children march out of
the city gates, going to meet the kings. But it
always grows dark before they come. The
children are afraid upon the lonely road and
hurry back to their homes, where the good
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">madres</span> hear them say one prayer to the Nene
Jesu, as they call the Christ-child, and then put
them to bed to dream of the Christmas kings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long, long ago there lived in Spain, in the
crowded part of a great city, an old woman
called Doña Josefa. The street in which she
lived was little and narrow, so narrow that if
you leaned out of the window of Doña Josefa’s
house you could touch with your finger-tips the
house across the way, and when you looked
above your head the sky seemed but a string
of blue, tying the houses all together. The
sun never found its way into this little street.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people who lived here were very poor,
as you may guess; Doña Josefa was poor,
likewise. But in one thing she was very rich—she
knew more stories than there were feast-days
in the year, and that is a great many.
Whenever there came a moment free from
work, when Doña Josefa had no water to fetch
from the public well, nor gold to stitch upon the
altar cloth for the Church of Santa Maria del
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Rosario, then she would run out of her house
into the street and call:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Niños, niños, come quickly! Here is a
story waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the children would come flying like the
gray palomas when corn is thrown for them in
the Plaza. Ah, how many children there
were in that little street! There were José and
Miguel, and the niños of Enrique, the cobbler,
Alfredito and Juana and Esperanza; and the
little twin sisters of Pancho, the peddler; and
Angela, Maria Teresa, Pedro, Edita, and many
more. Last of all there were Manuel and
Rosita. They had no father, and their mother
was a lavandera who stood all day on the
banks of the river outside the city, washing
clothes.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Doña Josefa had called the children
from all the doorways and the dark corners she
would sit down in the middle of the street and
gather them about her. This was safe because
the street was far too narrow to allow a horse
or wagon to pass through. Sometimes a donkey
would slowly pick its way along, or a stupid
goat come searching for things to eat, but that
was all.</p>

<p class='c011'>It happened on the day before Christmas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>that Doña Josefa had finished her work and
sat, as usual, with the children about her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-day you shall have a Christmas story,”
she said, and then she told them of the three
kings and the promise they had made the
Christ-child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And is it so—do the kings bring presents
to the children now?” Miguel asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Doña Josefa nodded her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why have they never left us one?
The three kings never pass this street on Christmas
Eve. Why is it, doña?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps it is because we have no shoes to
hold their gifts,” said Angela.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this is true. The poor children of Spain
go barefooted, and often never have a pair of
shoes till they grow up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Manuel had listened silently to the others,
but now he pulled the sleeve of Doña Josefa’s
gown with coaxing fingers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know why it is the kings bring no gifts to
us. See, the street; it is too small; their camels
could not pass between the door-steps here.
The kings must ride where the streets are broad
and smooth and clean, where their long mantles
will not be soiled and torn and the camels will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>not stumble. It is the children in the great
streets, the children of the rich, who find presents
in their <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">sapaticos</span> on Christmas morning.
Is it not so, Doña Josefa?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Miguel cried, “Does Manuel speak
true—is it only the children of the rich?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, chicito mio, it should not be so! When
the promise was given to the Nene Jesu there
in Bethlehem they said, ‘to every child.’ Yes,
every little child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is not strange they should forget us
here,” Manuel insisted. “The little street is
hidden in the shadow of the great ones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Rosita spoke, clasping her hands together
with great eagerness:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know; it is because we have no shoes!
That is why they never stop. Perhaps Enrique
would lend us the shoes he is mending, just
for one night. If we had shoes the kings would
surely see that there are little children in the
street, and leave a gift for each of us. Come,
let us ask Enrique!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Madre de Dios</span>, it is a blessed thought!”
cried all. And like the flock of gray palomas
they swept down the street to the farthest end,
where Enrique hammered and stitched away
all day on the shoes of the rich children.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Manuel stayed behind with Doña Josefa.
When the last pair of little brown feet had disappeared
inside the <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">sapateria</span> he said, softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If some one could go out and meet the
kings to tell them of this little street, and
how the niños here have never had a Christmas
gift, do you think they might ride hither
to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Doña Josefa shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If that were possible—But never have I
heard of any one who met the kings on Christmas
Eve.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All day in the city people hurried to and fro.
In the great streets flags were waving from the
housetops, and wreaths of laurel, or garlands of
heliotrope and mariposa, hung above the open
doorways and in the windows. Sweetmeat-sellers
were crying their wares; and the Keeper-of-the-City
lighted flaming torches to hang
upon the gates and city walls. Everywhere was
merrymaking and gladness, for not only was
this Christmas Eve, but the King of Spain was
coming to keep his holiday within the city.
Some whispered that he was riding from the
North, and with him rode his cousins, the kings
of France and Lombardy, and with them were
a great following of nobles, knights, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>minstrels. Others said the kings rode all alone—it
was their wish.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the sun was turning the cathedral spires
to shafts of gold, bands of children, hand in
hand, marched out of the city. They took the
road that led toward the setting sun, thinking
it was the East, and said among themselves,
“See, yonder is the way the kings will ride.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have brought a basket of figs,” cried
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have dates in a new panuela,” cried another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I,” cried a third, “I have brought a
sack of sweet limes, they are so cooling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus each in turn showed some small gift
that he was bringing for the kings. And while
they chatted together one child began to sing
the sweet Nativity Hymn. In a moment others
joined until the still night air rang with their
happy voices.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Behind the little hills the sun went down,
leaving a million sparks of light upon the
road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yonder come the kings!” the children cried.
“See the splendor of their shining crowns and
how the jewels sparkle on their mantles! They
may be angry if they find us out so late; come,
let us run home before they see us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The children turned. Back to the city gates
they ran, back to their homes, to the good
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">madres</span> watching for them and their own white
beds ready for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But one they left behind them on the road:
a little, bare-limbed boy whose name was
Manuel. He watched until the children had
disappeared within the gates, and then he
turned again toward the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no gift for the kings,” he thought,
“but there is fresh green grass beside the way
that I can gather for the camels.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped, pulled his hands full, and stuffed
it in the front of the little blue vestido that he
wore. He followed the road for a long way
until heavy sleep came to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How still it is upon the road! God has
blown out His light and soon it will be dark. I
wish I were with the others, safe within the city;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>for the dark is full of fearsome things when one
is all alone.... Mamita will be coming home
soon and bringing supper for Rosita and me.
Perhaps to-night there will be an almond dulce
or <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">pan de gloria</span>—perhaps.... I wonder will
Rosita not forget the little prayer I told her to
be always saying. My feet hurt with the many
stones; the night wind blows cold; I am weary
and my feet stumble with me.... Oh,
Nene Jesu, listen! I also make the prayer:
‘Send the three kings before Manuel is too
weary and afraid!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>A few more steps he took upon the road, and
then, as a reed is blown down by the wind,
Manuel swayed, unknowingly for a moment,
and slowly sank upon the ground, fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>How long he slept I cannot tell you; but a
hand on his shoulder wakened him. Quickly
he opened his eyes, wondering, and saw—yes,
he saw the three kings! Tall and splendid they
looked in the starlight, their mantles shimmering
with myriad gems. One stood above Manuel,
asking what he did upon the road at that
late hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Manuel rose to his feet, thrusting his hand
inside the shirt for the grass he had gathered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is for the camels, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>; I have no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>gift. But you—you ride horses this Christmas
Eve!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, we ride horses. What is that to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pardon, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</span>, nothing. The three kings
can ride horses if they wish; only—we were
told you rode on camels from the East.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does the child want?” The voice was
kind, but it sounded impatient, as though the
one who spoke had work waiting to be done and
was anxious to be about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Manuel heard and felt all this wondering.
“What if there is not time for them to come, or
gifts enough!” He laid an eager, pleading
hand on one king’s mantle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can hold the horses if you will come this
once. It is a little street and hard to find,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</span>; I thought perhaps you would leave a
present—just one little present for the children
there. You told the Christ-child you would
give to every child. Don’t you remember?
There are many of us who have never had a gift—a
Christmas gift.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know who we are?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manuel answered, joyfully: “Oh yes, <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Excellencias</span>,
you are the Three Christmas Kings,
riding from Bethlehem. Will you come with
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The kings spoke with one accord, “Verily,
we will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One lifted Manuel on his horse; and silently
they rode into the city. The Keeper slumbered
at the gates; the streets were empty. On, past
the houses that were garlanded they went unseen;
and on through the great streets until
they came to the little street at last. The
kings dismounted. They gave their bridles
into Manuel’s hand, and then, gathering up
their precious mantles of silk and rich brocade,
they passed down the little street. With eyes
that scarce believed what they saw, Manuel
watched them go from house to house, saw them
stop and feel for the shoes between the gratings,
the shoes loaned by Enrique, the cobbler, and
saw them fill each one with shining gold pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the morning Manuel told the story to the
children as they went to spend one golden
doblon for toys and candy and sugared cakes.
And a gift they brought for Doña Josefa, too;
a little figure of the Holy Mother with the
Christ-child in her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so the promise made in Bethlehem was
made again, and to a little child; and it was
kept. For many, many years, long after Manuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>was grown and had niños of his own, the
kings remembered the little street, and brought
their gifts there every Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long silence after David had
finished retelling the story to Barney and Johanna
that night. The wind was howling outside
and beating the snow in hard cakes against
the windows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, it’s up to some one to keep heart in
those two till spring comes,” Johanna said at
last. “Think o’ coming up here from one o’
them sizzling-hot places. Holy St. Patrick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, and a sick boy and a woman—the frail
kind, I’m thinking, not used to lifting her hand
to anything heavy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barney got up and peered out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if the snow’s not over our heads the
morrow I can beat my way there and keep their
fires going for another day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David got up and joined Barney, sliding a
grateful hand through his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would be bully! You know his mother
said if they could only keep the big fire going
on the open porch and get him out there again
she was sure he’d begin to get better. It’s
been the cold and the staying indoors that has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>put him back. Do you think, Barney, do you
think—You know I could take my turn at it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure and ye can, laddy. Wait till the
morrow and we’ll see what we can do—the two
of us.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRAPPER’S TALE OF THE FIRST BIRTHDAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The snow was still falling steadily next
morning and David came down to breakfast
with an anxious face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now don’t be worrying, laddy,” was Barney’s
reassuring greeting. “It takes a powerful
lot o’ snow to keep a man housed on these
hills when he has something fetching him out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Johanna, coming in with her hands full
of steaming griddle-cakes, brought more encouragement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, it’s a storm, but not too fierce for a
strong man like Barney to brave for them that’s
in trouble. And I’ve a can of good soup
jelly and a fresh-baked loaf of bread and some
eggs for ye to fetch with ye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” David dug his two hands down deep
in his pockets and smiled ecstatically. “I suppose—it’s
too bad going for me.” He appealed
to Barney.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Aye, it is that! Wait till afternoon. The
storm may break by then and ye could get out
for a bit. But there’s too much weather afoot
for a little lad just now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So David watched Barney make ready alone.
Johanna’s things were bundled and strapped on
his back that his two arms might be free.
Then he made fast his snow-shoes—it was no
day for skees—and pulling his fur parka down
to cover all but his eyes he started off. He
looked like a man of the northland. David
watched him out of sight, and then he and
Johanna fell to the making of a mammoth
Christmas cake. There were nuts to be cracked
and fruits to be chopped; all good boy work,
as Johanna said, and he was glad to be busy.</p>

<p class='c011'>At noon Barney returned with great news.
He had left the South-Americans comfortable
and happy. Alfredo was back on his open
porch with a monstrous fire roaring up the
outside chimney and wood enough stacked within
their reach for them to keep it going for a
week. The mother had wept over Johanna’s
gifts. They had lived for days on canned
things and stale bread; and she had blessed
them all in what Barney had termed “Spanish
lingo.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Sure, ye needn’t be fearing about them
longer, laddy; they’ve the hearts back in them
again, and, what’s more, they’ll stay there, I’m
thinking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Barney had prophesied, the snow stopped
at noon; and after dinner David set forth on his
last quest. Warnings from Johanna and Barney
followed him out of the lodge: not to be
going far—and to mind well his trail. All of
which he promised. It was not so very far to
the trapper’s and the trail was as plain as the
hillside itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no sign of the locked-out fairy, and
David expected none. There was but one
path left to take. Why should any one come to
show him the way? Although the trail lay
down the hill David’s going was very slow.
He sank deep at every step and where the
drifts were high he had to make long detours,
which nearly doubled the distance. When he
reached the hut at last he met the trapper at
his very door-sill. The pack on his back looked
full, and David guessed he had just been down
to the village for supplies. He eyed David
with a grave concern through the opening in his
parka; and David wondered whether the rest of
the face would be grave, or kind, or forbidding.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Nicholas Bassaraba has few visitors, but
you are welcome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice was gruff but not unkindly, and
the trapper pushed open the door of his hut
and motioned David inside. They stood stamping
the snow from their boots; and then the
trapper lifted his hood and David saw that he
was not at all like the Grimm picture of Bluebeard.
He was dark and swarthy-skinned, to
be sure, but he wore no beard—only a small
mustache—and his eyebrows were not heavy
and sinister-looking and his mouth was almost
friendly. If the line of gravity should break
into a smile David felt sure it would be a very
friendly smile. The trapper proceeded to remove
the rest of his outer garments and David
did the same. When the operation was over
they stood there facing each other solemnly—a
very large, foreign-looking man and a small
American boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come! This is a day to sit close to the
fire and to smoke, if one is big. If one happens
to be small, there is—let me see—I think
there is chocolate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The trapper opened a small cupboard and
drew out a tinfoiled package which he tossed
over to David; then from his pocket he brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>a pipe and a pouch. He held the pipe empty
between his teeth, while he rebuilt the fire that
was low on the hearth. When the fresh wood
began to snap he drew up a chair for each of
them, close, and proceeded to fill his pipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>David gazed curiously about the room. It
was large and it seemed to serve as kitchen,
dining-room, sleeping and living quarters, all
combined. The end where they sat by the
open fireplace was for living and sleeping; the
two comfortable chairs, the table with a reading-lamp,
the small case with books, and the couch
plainly told this. At the other end was a cookstove,
the cupboard, water-pails, dish-rack, frying-pans
and pots hanging against the wall, and
a rough pine table with a straight chair. The
walls were covered with skins and guns, cartridge-belts,
and knives of all descriptions.
Altogether David found it a very interesting
place, almost as interesting as the man who
lived there. His eyes came back to the trapper,
who again was considering him gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a bully good place for a man to live in,”
was David’s enthusiastic comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is good enough for one who must live a
stranger, in a strange land.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For all his rough clothes and his calling, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>man spoke more like a scholar than a backwoodsman;
David had noticed that the first
time he had spoken. He spoke with as educated
a tongue as his own father; there was
a slight foreign twist to it, that was the only
difference.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is your country?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David asked it simply, not out of idle curiosity,
but to place the man at home in his own
mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My country? Ah, what used to be my
country is a little place, not so big as this one
state of yours. It is somewhere near the blue
Mediterranean, but it is nearer to Prussia.
Bah! What does it matter? Nicholas Bassaraba
knows no country now but the woods;
no people but those.” He pointed to the skins
on the walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you kill them!” The accusation was
out before David realized it was even on his
tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, what would you have me do? I must
live. Is that not so? And is it not better to
live on the creatures of the woods than on one’s
fellow-men? I kill only what I need for sustenance;
for the rest I hurt not one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a hidden fierceness back of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>soft voice and David felt immediately apologetic:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me! Of course it’s all right. I only
thought when you spoke of them as your people,
and then pointed to their pelts hung around, it
sounded sort of barbaric. Sort of like the
Indians showing off their scalps, or the headhunters
showing their skulls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The trapper smiled, and the smile was
friendly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Youth is ever quick to accuse and as quick
to forgive. I know. It is hard for you to
understand how I can make them my friends
through the long summer; and then, when
winter comes and there is a price on their
fur, trap them and kill them. But Nicholas
Bassaraba kills only enough to bring him in the
bare needs of life, and then only for one half
the year. For the rest, I am a guide; I carry
the packs for the gentlemen campers; I build
their fires; I draw their water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The smile changed to a contemptuous curl of
the lips. “Such it is to be a man locked out of
his own country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David watched him uncomfortably for an
instant. Then he laughed—he could not help
it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“You’re not the only one. There are two
more of us; and I don’t know but what you’d
call the flagman another, and Uncle Joab, and
maybe the South-Americans, too. You see,
I’m just sort of locked out, but the others are
truly locked out.” And David launched into
an account of himself and of what he knew of
the others, all but the fairy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And is that all? I thought you said there
was another person,” reminded the trapper.</p>

<p class='c011'>David blushed consciously. Not that there
was the slightest reason for blushing. He certainly
felt no shame in his acquaintanceship
with the locked-out fairy. It was rather the
feeling of shyness in having to put it all into
words, and there was always the uncertainty
of how a stranger would take it. You never
could tell how people were going to take fairies,
anyhow. Besides, maybe there were no fairies
in what had been this man’s country.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The other is not exactly a person,” David
began, slowly, “not exactly. Say, did you ever
see a fairy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A look of amazement filled the face of the
trapper. It seemed to well up from his eyes
and burst forth from his mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean the little people?” he asked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>last. “The nixies and the dwarfs and the
kobolds, that live under the earth and play
pranks on us unsuspecting mortals?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David nodded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sort of. Have you ever seen one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The trapper shook his head vehemently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, <i>I</i> have!” And without in the least
understanding why he was doing it David told
the story of the locked-out fairy.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he had finished, the trapper was smiling
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, the poor manikin! And here there
are three, five, seven of us, all locked out from
our homelands; and here was I, Nicholas Bassaraba,
thinking I was the only one to feel the
homesickness. Bah! Sometimes a man is a
fool!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought a minute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you say he wore the squirrel coat—the
very one I missed from the shed door where it
was drying? And all the time I think it was
the African from the lumber-camp who takes
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed aloud and stretched his arms out
with a little cry of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, it is good, very good, for one outcast
to clothe another. To-night I must put out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>some bread and honey, as my people used to
for the little spirits; the manikin may be
hungry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me,” said David, suddenly, “do your
people have any stories—stories of Christmas?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Christmas!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The trapper repeated it—almost as if it were
a strange word to him. “Wait a minute—keep
very still. I will see can I think back a story
of Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David sat without stirring, almost without
breathing, as the trapper puffed silently at his
pipe. He puffed the bowl quite empty, then
knocking the ashes clean out of his pipe he put
it back in his pocket again and looked up at
David with the old grave look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a people in our country who are
called wanderers; some say they have been
wanderers for two thousand years. You call
them gipsies or Egyptians; we call them
‘Tzigan.’ Now, they are vagabonds, for the
most part, dirty, thieving rascals, ready to tell
a fortune or pick a pocket, as the fancy takes
them; but—it was not always so. Some say
that they have been cursed because they feared
to give shelter to Mary and Joseph and the
Child when the King of Judea forced them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>flee into Egypt. But the gipsies themselves say
that this is not true; and this is the story the
Tzigan mothers tell their children on the night
of Christmas, as they sit around the fire that is
always burning in the heart of a Romany camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was winter—and twelve months since the
gipsies had driven their flocks of mountain-sheep
over the dark, gloomy Balkans, and had
settled in the southlands near to the Ægean.
It was twelve months since they had seen a
wonderful star appear in the sky and heard the
singing of angelic voices afar off.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had marveled much concerning the star
until a runner had passed them from the South
bringing them news that the star had marked
the birth of a Child whom the wise men had
hailed as “King of Israel” and “Prince of
Peace.” This had made Herod of Judea both
afraid and angry and he had sent soldiers secretly
to kill the Child; but in the night they
had miraculously disappeared—the Child with
Mary and Joseph—and no one knew whither
they had gone. Therefore Herod had sent
runners all over the lands that bordered the
Mediterranean with a message forbidding every
one giving food or shelter or warmth to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Child, under penalty of death. For Herod’s
anger was far-reaching and where his anger fell
there fell his sword likewise. Having given his
warning, the runner passed on, leaving the
gipsies to marvel much over the tale they had
heard and the meaning of the star.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now on that day that marked the end of the
twelve months since the star had shone the
gipsies said among themselves: “Dost thou
think that the star will shine again to-night?
If it were true, what the runner said, that when
it shone twelve months ago it marked the place
where the Child lay it may even mark His
hiding-place this night. Then Herod would
know where to find Him, and send his soldiers
again to slay Him. That would be a cruel thing
to happen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The air was chill with the winter frost, even
there in the southland, close to the Ægean; and
the gipsies built high their fire and hung their
kettle full of millet, fish, and bitter herbs for
their supper. The king lay on his couch of
tiger-skins and on his arms were amulets of
heavy gold, while rings of gold were on his
fingers and in his ears. His tunic was of heavy
silk covered with a leopard cloak, and on his
feet were shoes of goat-skin trimmed with fur.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Now, as they feasted around the fire a voice
came to them through the darkness, calling.
It was a man’s voice, climbing the mountains
from the south.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ohe! Ohe!” he shouted. And then nearer,
“O—he!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The gipsies were still disputing among themselves
whence the voice came when there walked
into the circle about the fire a tall, shaggy man,
grizzled with age, and a sweet-faced young
mother carrying a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are outcasts,” said the man, hoarsely.
“Ye must know that whosoever succors us will
bring Herod’s vengeance like a sword about his
head. For a year we have wandered homeless
and cursed over the world. Only the wild creatures
have not feared to share their food and give
us shelter in their lairs. But to-night we can go
no farther; and we beg the warmth of your fire
and food enough to stay us until the morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king looked at them long before he made
reply. He saw the weariness in their eyes and
the famine in their cheeks; he saw, as well, the
holy light that hung about the child, and he
said at last to his men:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the Child of Bethlehem, the one they
call the ‘Prince of Peace.’ As yon man says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>who shelters them shelters the wrath of Herod
as well. Shall we let them tarry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>One of their number sprang to his feet, crying:
“It is a sin to turn strangers from the fire, a
greater sin if they be poor and friendless.
And what is a king’s wrath to us? I say bid
them welcome. What say the rest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with one accord the gipsies shouted,
“Yea, let them tarry!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They brought fresh skins and threw them
down beside the fire for the man and woman to
rest on. They brought them food and wine,
and goat’s milk for the Child; and when they
had seen that all was made comfortable for
them they gathered round the Child—these
black gipsy men—to touch His small white
hands and feel His golden hair. They brought
Him a chain of gold to play with and another
for His neck and tiny arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See, these shall be Thy gifts, little one,”
said they, “the gifts for Thy first birthday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And long after all had fallen asleep the Child
lay on His bed of skins beside the blazing fire
and watched the light dance on the beads of
gold. He laughed and clapped His hands together
to see the pretty sight they made; and
then a bird called out of the thicket close by.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Little Child of Bethlehem,” it called, “I,
too, have a birth gift for Thee. I will sing
Thy cradle song this night.” And softly, like
the tinkling of a silver bell and like clear water
running over mossy places, the nightingale sang
and sang, filling the air with melodies.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then another voice called to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Child of Bethlehem, I am only a
tree with boughs all bare, for the winter has
stolen my green cloak, but I also can give Thee
a birth gift. I can give Thee shelter from the
biting north wind that blows.” And the tree
bent low its branches and twined a rooftree
and a wall about the Child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon the Child was fast asleep, and while He
slept a small brown bird hopped out of the
thicket. Cocking his little head, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can I be giving the Child of Bethlehem?
I could fetch Him a fat worm to eat or
catch Him the beetle that crawls on yonder
bush, but He would not like that! And I could
tell Him a story of the lands of the north, but
He is asleep and would not hear.” And the
brown bird shook its head quite sorrowfully.
Then it saw that the wind was bringing the
sparks from the fire nearer and nearer to the
sleeping Child.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I know what I can do,” said the bird, joyously.
“I can catch the hot sparks on my
breast, for if one should fall upon the Child
it would burn Him grievously.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the small brown bird spread wide his
wings and caught the sparks on his own brown
breast. So many fell that the feathers were
burned; and burned was the flesh beneath
until the breast was no longer brown, but
red.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next morning, when the gipsies awoke, they
found Mary and Joseph and the Child gone.
For Herod had died, and an angel had come in
the night and carried them back to the land of
Judea. But the good God blessed those who
had cared that night for the Child.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the nightingale He said: “Your song shall
be the sweetest in all the world, for ever and
ever; and only you shall sing the long night
through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To the tree He said: “Little fir-tree, never
more shall your branches be bare. Winter and
summer you and your seedlings shall stay green,
ever green.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Last of all He blessed the brown bird:
“Faithful little watcher, from this night forth
you and your children shall have red breasts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>that the world may never forget your gift to
the Child of Bethlehem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The trapper smiled gravely at David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that, my friend, was the robin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know,” said David, simply.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt very still and quiet inside, almost as
if he had dreamed himself into the Romany
camp beside the fire, and seen with his own eyes
the coming of the Child. It seemed too real,
too close to talk about just then; he even forgot
to tell the trapper that he liked it. And then
the trapper’s next words brought him to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not knowing, it may be, that the
night has fallen and the snow is with it again.
Come, I think Nicholas Bassaraba will guide
you safely to your hilltop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One glance through the window told David
the truth of the words. It was almost dark outside
and snow was very thick in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Silently they put on their garments and
fastened their snow-shoes. Then with the command
to keep close at his heels, the trapper
led the way up the trail.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first thing of which David was conscious
was that his strength was going amazingly fast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>It seemed but a moment since he had started,
and the trapper was climbing very slowly; yet
David began to find it unbelievably hard to pull
one foot after the other. Gritting his teeth, he
stumbled on a few yards farther. Then he fell,
picked himself up, and fell again. The third
time the trapper helped him to his feet, and,
coming behind him, he put a strong hand at
David’s back and pushed. They struggled on
this way for another ten minutes until David
fell again. This time it was the trapper’s
strength alone which righted him, for David’s
had entirely gone. He stood looking with
dazed eyes into the trapper’s, ashamed and
wholly spent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is all right. It is nothing to be ashamed
of.” The trapper’s voice seemed to come from
very far away. “You have climbed many
lengths farther than I expected. Now you
shall see how Nicholas Bassaraba can pack a
hundred pounds when he is guiding for a friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stooped and lifted David on his back,
drawing the boy’s arms well over his shoulders,
and slipping his own firmly under the boy’s
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the last David knew until he felt
the ground under his feet again and blinked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>stupidly at the light Johanna was holding at
the open door of the lodge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Laddy, laddy, wherever have ye been?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He heard the distress in Johanna’s voice even
through his own numbness, and tried to smile
reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Barney’s been scouring the hill for ye this
half-hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has been to visit a friend, and the friend
has brought him back safely,” said the trapper.
And without another word he disappeared in
the snow and the darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE CHRISTMAS THAT WAS NEARLY LOST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>It snowed hard all the next day, so hard that
even Barney did not venture out; and
David spent his time between the kitchen,
where Johanna was frosting the Christmas cake,
and the woodshed, where Barney was making
the “woodpile look mortal weary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David’s mind was full of the happenings of
the days that had passed, and of future plans.
Everything had been as fine as a boy could
wish, but he did not want it to stop. Here it
was two days before Christmas, and he was
quite sure there was still a lot to be found.
The question was, where should he look for it
now that the matter of neighbors had been
exhausted?</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the plans, they were growing every
minute; but he had decided to say nothing
about them to Johanna and Barney until the
next day, when they were full-grown. Of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>thing David felt certain: nothing could keep
Christmas away this year. And so when Barney
began to tease him on one of his trips to the
woodshed and say that if this weather lasted
he guessed the Christmas present from father
would get there about Washington’s Birthday
and that he guessed it would take a Santa Claus
with seven-league boots to make the hilltop this
year, David just smiled and looked very wise.
Something was going to happen; he knew perfectly
well that something was going to happen.
And so, when it actually did happen,
about half-way between dinner and supper
time, he was not nearly as surprised as Johanna
and Barney, who in a way might have expected
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were all three startled by a banging on
the door and a stamping and pounding of feet
outside. So loud did it sound in the midst of
the silence that David thought there must be
at least a dozen men. Great was his astonishment,
therefore, when Barney swung open the
door and a solitary figure stepped in, muffled in
fur to the eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Burrrrrrrrrrr!” boomed the figure, and then
he swept off his cap and made a laughing bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello, Johanna! Hello, Barney! You never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>thought I would remind you right in the midst
of a Christmas blizzard of that promise you
made last summer. Come now, did you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Holy St. Patrick!” gasped Johanna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Peter!” ejaculated Barney. “But how
in the name of all the saints did ye ever make it
in this storm?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man laughed again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just the usual nerve of the tenderfoot. I
left my painting-kit, bag, and canvases with the
station-agent. He has promised to send them
up if the storm ever stops. And I made a
wager with him—a gallon can of next spring’s
syrup against a box of cigars—that I’d be here
by four o’clock. What’s the time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had his things off by this time and was
looking at his watch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aha! Ten minutes to the good! If your
wires are not down, Barney, I’ll call him up.
He’ll be wanting to get ready to tap that
maple-tree.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment they could hear his voice
booming at the telephone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, siree. Here I am, and not even my
breath frozen. No, you needn’t be sending out
that snow-plow after me just yet. Only get my
things up here as soon as you can. All right!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Another instant he was back in the room
again, vigorously shaking Johanna’s and Barney’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, here I am, to paint those snow canvases
I’ve been going to do so long, and to
dodge Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it was that for the first time he became
conscious of David in the window recess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless my soul! Who’s this, Johanna?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Johanna explained, and David came forward
and held out an eager hand. He liked this
Mr. Peter tremendously, in spite of his last remark,
and he was no end glad he had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man returned David’s greeting with equal
cordiality, while he screwed up his face into a
comical expression of mock disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I came up here to dodge Christmas!
Say, young man, do you think it’s possible for
any person to get away from Christmas with a
boy around?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope not,” laughed David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t mean to tell me that Christmas
hasn’t grown into a very tiresome, shabby affair
that we would all escape from if we only had the
courage? You don’t believe there is anything
in it nowadays, do you, except the beastly
grind of paying your friends back and thanking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>your lucky stars it doesn’t happen oftener than
once a year?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I certainly do, sir.” David spoke as one
with authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man rubbed his hands together thoughtfully
and his eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see. Johanna and Barney have gone off
to fix a bed for me somewhere, so suppose we
discuss this matter thoroughly. I’ll tell you
my personal feelings and you can tell me yours.
In the end, maybe we’ll compromise!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He led the way to the window-seat and spread
himself out comfortably in one corner; David
curled up in the one opposite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To begin with,” and the man pounded his
knee emphatically, “Christmas is responsible
for a very bad economic condition. Every one
spends more money than he has; that’s very
bad. Next, you generally put your money into
articles that are neither useful nor beautiful;
you give your maiden aunt handkerchiefs and
she has ten dozen of them already put by in her
closet, while you send a box of candy to the
janitor’s little girl, who can’t go out because
she hasn’t any shoes to wear. Now if I could
borrow an invisible cloak and go around a week
before Christmas, peeping in on all the folks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>that need things and finding out just what they
need, and then come back on Christmas Eve
and drop the gifts unseen beside their doors—well,
that might make Christmas seem a little
less shabby. But as it is, I’m not going to give
away an inch of foolish Christmas this year.
And I’m not going to say ‘Merry Christmas’ to
a solitary soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe you’ll forget,” laughed David.
“Now, is it my turn?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Peter nodded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ve found out, just lately, that
Christmas isn’t things—it’s thoughts. And
I’ve an idea how to make a bully Christmas this
year out of nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He hunched up one knee and clasped his
arms about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see, I used to think that you couldn’t
have Christmas without all the store fixings and
lots of presents, just as you do. And when I
first came ’way up here I thought it was just
naturally ‘good-by, Christmas.’ Then something
happened.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose you tell me what. We might
make a better compromise if I understood just
what did happen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>David considered him thoughtfully. Johanna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>had said while he was out at the telephone
that Mr. Peter was a painter, a bachelor
chap with no one in particular belonging to
him, and David wondered if he would really
understand. As Johanna had often said,
“There are some things you just can’t put
through a body’s head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Things happen ’way up here in the hills that
would never happen in the city, never in a
hundred years,” he began, slowly; and then,
gaining courage from the painter’s nod of comprehension,
he told all about everything. Of
course he could not tell all the stories as they
had been told to him—there was not time—but
he told about them, and particularly about the
“heathen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that isn’t all,” he finished, breathlessly.
“I’ve a great plan for to-morrow night, if
Johanna and Barney and you will help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We might make that the compromise,”
smiled Mr. Peter. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>David told, and when he had quite finished,
the man beside him nodded his head as if he
approved.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does Johanna say?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I haven’t told her yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we’ll ask Johanna and Barney to-night.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Now let’s hunt them up and find out
when supper is going to be ready. I’m as
hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But before the plans were unfolded to Barney
and Johanna that evening Mr. Peter told a
story. He offered it himself as something he
had picked up once upon a time, he could not
remember just where. He said it was not the
kind of a story he would ever make up in the
wide world, but he thought it just the kind
David might make up.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here it is as the painter told it two nights
before Christmas:</p>

<p class='c009'>It was four o’clock on Christmas morning and
Santa Claus was finishing his rounds just as the
milkman was beginning his. Santa had been
over to Holland and back again where he had
filled millions of little Dutch shoes that stood
outside of windows and doors; he had climbed
millions of chimneys and filled millions of
American stockings, not to mention the billions
and trillions of Christmas trees that he had
trimmed and the nurseries he had visited with
toys too large for stockings. And now, just as
the clock struck four, he had filled his last
stocking and was crawling out of the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>chimney onto the roof where the eight reindeer
were pawing the snow and wagging their stumps
of tails, eager to be off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Santa Claus heaved a sigh of relief as he shook
the creases out of the great magic bag that
was always large enough to hold all the toys
that were put into it. The bag was quite
empty now, not even a gum-drop or a penny
whistle was left; and Santa heaved another
sigh as he tucked it under the seat of his sleigh
and clambered wearily in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the two horns on yonder pale-looking
moon,” quoth he, “I’m a worn-out old saint and
I am glad Christmas is over. Why, I passed
my prime some thousand years ago and any
other saint would have taken to his niche in
heaven long before this.” And he heaved a
third sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he took up the reins and whistled to his
team he looked anything but the jolly old saint
he was supposed to be; and if you had searched
him from top to toe, inside and out, you
couldn’t have found a chuckle or a laugh anywhere
about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away went the eight reindeer through the
air, higher and higher, till houses looked like
match-boxes and lakes like bowls of water; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>it took them just ten minutes and ten seconds
to carry Santa safely home to the North Pole.
Most generally he sings a rollicking song on his
homeward journey, a song about boys and toys
and drums and plums, just to show how happy
he is. But this year he spent the whole time
grumbling all the grumbly thoughts he could
think of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a pretty state of affairs when a man
can’t have a vacation in nearly five hundred
years. Christmas every three hundred and
sixty-five days and have to work three hundred
and sixty-four of them to get things ready.
What’s more, every year the work grows harder.
Have to keep up with all the scientific inventions
and all the new discoveries. Who’d have
thought a hundred years ago that I should have
to be building toy aeroplanes and electric motors?
And the girls want dolls’ houses with
lights and running water! I declare I’m fairly
sick of the sight of a sled or a top, and dolls
and drums make me shiver. I’d like to do
nothing for a whole year, I tell you—nothing!
It’s a pretty how d’ y’ do if the world can’t get
along for one year without a Christmas.
What’s to prevent my taking a vacation like
any other man? Who’s to prevent me?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The reindeer had stopped outside of Santa’s
own home and he threw the reins down with a
jerk while he tried his best to look very gruff
and surly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose I try it. By the Aurora Borealis,
I <i>will</i> try it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then and there Santa Claus began his
vacation.</p>

<p class='c011'>He closed up his workshop, locked the door,
and hung the key in the attic. He turned his
reindeer loose and told them to go south where
they could get fresh grass, for he would not need
them for a year and a day. Then he made
himself comfortable beside his fire, and brought
out all the books and the papers he had been
wanting to read for the last fifty years or more,
and settled down to enjoy himself. He never
gave one thought to the world or what it would
do without him; therefore, it never occurred to
him to wonder if the news would get in the
papers. But you know and I know that in
time everything that happens gets into the
papers; so the news spread at last all over the
world that Santa Claus was taking a vacation
and that there would be no Christmas next year.
And what do you think happened then?</p>

<p class='c011'>First of all the Christmas trees stopped growing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“What’s the use?” they whispered one to
another. “We sha’n’t be wanted this year, so
we needn’t work to put out new shoots or keep
especially green and smart-looking.” And the
holly and the mistletoe heard them, and they
said: “Well, why should we bother, either, to
get our berries ready as long as we shall not be
needed for decoration? Making berries takes a
lot of time, and we might just as well spend it
gossiping.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, the storekeepers began to grumble, and
each said to himself, “Well, if Christmas isn’t
coming this year why should I spend my time
making my shop-windows gay with gifts and
pretty things?” And the pastry cooks and the
confectioners said they certainly would not
bother making plum-puddings, Christmas pies,
or candy canes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon the children heard about it. For a long
while they would not believe it, not until
Christmas-time came round again. But when
they saw the Christmas trees looking so short
and shabby, and the Christmas greens without
their berries, and the streets quiet and dull, and
the shop-windows without the pretty things in
them, they grew sober and quiet, too. And in
less time than I can tell you the whole world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>grew stuffy and stupid and silent and unlovely.
Yes, the whole world!</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, in a very small house in a very small
town that stands just midway between the
North Pole and the equator and half-way between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans (you can
find the town for yourself on any map if you
look for it with these directions) there lived a
small boy. He was sturdy and strong, and he
had learned two great lessons—never to be
afraid and never to give up. He saw what was
happening all over the world, because everybody
believed that Christmas had been lost, and
he said one day to his mother:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, little mother, I’ve been thinking
this long while if Santa Claus could see how
things are going with every one down here he
would bring Christmas back, after all. Let me
go and tell him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Boy, little boy,” said his mother, “tell me
first how you will find your way there. Remember
there are no sign-posts along the road
that leads to Santa Claus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the boy squared his shoulders and took
a firm grip of his pockets and said he, “Why,
that’s easy! I’ll ask the way and keep on till
I get there.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>In the end his mother let him go. As he
walked along slowly he questioned everything
he passed—birds, grass, winds, rain, river, trees.
All these he asked the fastest road to Santa
Claus; and each in turn showed him the way
as far as he knew it. The birds flew northward,
singing for him to follow after; the grass
swayed and bent and made a beaten path for
him; the river carried him safely along its
banks in the tiniest shell of a boat, while the
winds blew it to make it go faster. Each horse
or donkey that he met carried him as far as he
could; and every house door was opened wide
to him, and the children shared with him their
bowls of bread-and-milk or soup. And wherever
he passed, both the children and the grownups
alike called after him, “You’ll tell him;
you’ll make Santa Claus come and bring our
Christmas back to us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot begin to tell you the wonderful
things that happened to the boy. He traveled
quickly and safely, for all that it was a long
road with no sign-posts marking the way; and
just three days before Christmas he reached the
North Pole and knocked at Santa Claus’s front
door. It was opened by Santa himself, who
rubbed his eyes with wonder.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Bless my red jacket and my fur boots!” he
cried in astonishment. “If it isn’t a real, live
boy! How did you get here, sirrah?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy told him everything in just two sentences;
and when he had finished he begged
Santa to change his mind and keep Christmas
for the children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t do it. Don’t want to. Couldn’t if I
did. Not a thing made. Nothing to make anything
of. And you can’t have Christmas without
toys and sweets. Go look in that window
and see for yourself.” And the old saint
finished quite out of breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy went over to the window Santa had
pointed out and, standing on tiptoe, peered in.
There was the workshop as empty as a barn in
the spring. Spiders had built their webs across
the corners and mice scampered over the floors,
and that was all. The boy went slowly back to
Santa and his face looked very sad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen to this,” he said, and he took a seashell
from his pocket and held it close to old
Santa’s ear. “Can you hear anything?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Santa listened with his forehead all puckered
up and a finger against his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph! It sounds like somebody crying
away off.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“It’s the children,” said the little boy, “as I
heard them while I passed along the road that
brought me here. And do you know why they
were crying? Because there are no trees to
light, no candles to burn, no stockings to hang,
no carols to sing, no holly to make into wreaths—no
gladness anywhere. And they are very
frightened because Christmas has been lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Santa did the funniest thing. He blew
his nose so hard that he blew tears into his eyes
and down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fee, fi, fo, fum—I’m a stupid old fool!” said
he. “It’s too late to do Christmas alone this
year; but I might—yes, I might—get help.
The world is full of spirits who love the children
as much as I do. If they will lend me a hand,
this once, we might do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he went into his house and brought out
his wonderful magic whistle that calls the reindeer;
and he blew it once, twice, three times;
and the next instant the eight were bounding
over the snow toward him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go!” he commanded. “Go as quickly as
ever you can to all the spirits of the earth,
water, and air, and tell them Santa Claus needs
their help this year to bring back Christmas to
the children.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Away flew the reindeer, and in less time than
it takes a cloud to scud across the sky they were
back again and with them the most wonderful
gathering that has ever been seen since the
world was made. There were giants from
Norway and trolls from Sweden; there were
dwarfs and elves from the mines of Cornwall
and fairies from the hills of Ireland; there were
brownies from Scotland and goblins from Germany;
the Yule <span lang="da" xml:lang="da">nisse</span> and the skrattle from Denmark;
and fairy godmothers from everywhere.
And from the ocean came the mermaids and
the mermen; and from the rivers and brooks
came nixies and nymphs and swan maidens.
And they all came eager to help. Santa Claus
brought down from the attic the key of the workshop
and soon everybody was busy at his own
particular craft. Not a word was spoken, and
for those three days not a soul rested or slept.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dwarfs and the elves made hammers and
planes and saws, knives and slates, trumpets
and drums, rings and pins and necklaces of
precious stones, for they are the oldest metalworkers
under the sun. And the fairies are the
finest spinners; and they spun cloth of silk,
ribbons and fine laces, yes, and flaxen hair for
dolls. The leprechaun, who is the fairy cobbler,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>made slippers of all colors and sizes from baby-dolls’
shoes to real little girls’ party slippers
and boys’ skating-boots. The giants cut down
trees and sawed them into logs and boards
while the trolls made them into boats and
houses, sleds and beds and carriages. The
mermaids gathered shells and pearls for beads;
the brownies stitched and sewed and dressed
the dolls that Santa himself had made. I don’t
know what the nixies made, unless it was the
sea-foam candy.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was one little goblin too little to know
how to do anything, and as no one had time to
teach him he wandered about, very unhappy,
until a bright idea popped into his head. Then
away he scuttled down to the timber-lands to
tell the Christmas trees to hurry up and try to
grow a bit, because the children would need
them, after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, the long and short of it was that on
Christmas Eve everything was finished; and
never since Santa Claus was a lad himself had
there been such an array of toys. They were
so fine and they shone so bright that the
children going to bed that night said to one
another, “Look up yonder and see the Northern
Lights!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The toys were at last packed in the sleigh and
the boy climbed in on the seat next to Santa,
and they were just driving away when a wee
old Irish fairy woman stepped up with a great
bundle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis stockings,” said she. “I’ve knitted
one for every child, for I knew well the poor
things would never be hanging up their own
this night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So it happened that the Christmas that was
nearly lost was found, after all, and when the
children woke up in the morning they saw their
stockings full of toys and the tall green trees all
trimmed and waiting for them. And when
Santa reached the North Pole again, very tired
and sleepy, but not at all grumbly, he heard a
noise that sounded like running brooks and
singing birds and waving grasses and blowing
winds all wrapped up together; and he said
to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear,dear me! what can that be? It sounds
very like the laughter of little children all over
the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And that is precisely what it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had finished, Mr. Peter leaned over
and whispered to David; and David cleared his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>throat as if he were going to make a long speech.
Then he told his plan to Barney and Johanna
and asked them would they do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The heathens!” was all Johanna said; but
she sounded distinctly surprised, almost
shocked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” said Barney. “Mind, your calling
them that doesn’t make them it. And
what if they were? Is that any reason?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe not,” agreed Johanna. “Only when
a body’s got the habit o’ thinking folks are not
her kind o’ folks it takes a powerful bit o’
thinking to think them different.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure it does. We’ll leave ye to do the thinking
while the three of us go out to the woodshed
and knock together them sign-posts the
little lad is wishing for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Barney led the way, while a very happy
boy and a man with an amused twinkle in his
eyes followed at his heels.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>IX<br /> <span class='large'>ST. BRIDGET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The day before Christmas broke cold and
clear; and almost before the sun had
crested the hill three fur-clad figures were
abroad. Two were large and one was small;
each carried a post across his shoulders, while
the foremost swung an ax in his free hand.
They first took the trail for the trapper’s, and
a dozen yards from the hut they planted one
post, knocking it firmly into the snow with the
flat of the ax. There it stood straight as could
be and about the height of a little lad, with its
white sign pointing up the trail they had come
and its bands of Christmas green and red—painted
by Mr. Peter at the top—warranted
to attract attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>David cast a backward glance of admiration
upon it as they turned to cross-cut the ravine
and climb the foot-hill that led to the South-Americans’
cottage. Yes, it certainly did look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>fine! And how well the black letters stood out
against the white background! With a heart almost
bursting with the fullness of contentment
David read the sign for the hundredth time:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>THIS WAY TO CHRISTMAS</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Six o’Clock To-night. Please Come.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>David</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And the hand pointed straight to the hilltop
and the lodge. Another sign was planted
by the cottage, and a third by the lumber-camp.
Then the trio climbed the hill again.
At the lodge Barney picked up a fourth post.
He was going down to the village for some
necessary supplies and he had been appointed
to leave the sign for the flagman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s just one thing that’s the matter,”
said David, as he and Mr. Peter started out
with knives and bags to hunt for ground-pine
and other Christmas greens. “It’s the South-Americans.
I don’t see how they could possibly
get here. Why, the sick boy has hardly
enough strength to walk across the room. And
you couldn’t expect a lady to climb a mountain
on snow-shoes, just for Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Peter laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“You can never tell what’s going to happen
Christmas Eve. Maybe the fairy will loan
them his wishing-cap. Or Santa, himself, may
swing round here on his way to the city and
bring them along. I wouldn’t begin to worry
about who’s not coming until it’s too late for
them to get here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All through that crisp winter morning David
and Mr. Peter plowed back and forth between
the woods and the lodge, carrying green of every
description, with intervals spent beside the
kitchen stove, warming up. And early in the
afternoon they started decorating the hall and
living-room, while Johanna and Barney concentrated
their efforts in the kitchen. Barney
had succeeded in rooting out untold treasures
from the shelves of the “variety store” in the
village; and he had brought home several cans
of silver paint and rolls of red tissue-paper, besides
some white and red candles.</p>

<p class='c011'>With these Mr. Peter and David created
miracles. They silvered bunches of the pine-cones
and hung them on their drooping green
branches above the doorways and windows.
They trailed the ground-pine across the ceiling
from corner to corner, and about the mantel,
hanging from it innumerable tiny red bells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fashioned from the red paper. They stood two
tall young spruces on either side of the window
niche and these they trimmed with strips of
pop-corn, silvered nuts and pine-cones and red
and white candles. And every window had a
hemlock wreath made gay with cranberries.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Barney and Johanna? They were likewise
performing miracles. When David and
Mr. Peter had finished and given their work a
last survey and exchanged a final round of mutual
congratulations they went into the kitchen
to behold the others’ handiwork.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the table lengthened out and covered
with a snowy-white cloth. In the center,
surrounded by a wreath of green, stood the
mammoth Christmas cake; and at the four
corners stood tall white candles in crystal candlesticks.
At one end was a cold baked ham
resplendent with its crust of sugar and cloves
and its paper frill of red and white. At the
other was a red Japanese bowl filled with the
vegetable salad that had made Johanna famous;
while dotted all about the table were delectable
dishes of all sorts—jams and jellies, nuts, raisins,
savory pickles, and a pyramid of maple-sugar
cream. But it was from the stove that the appetizing
odors came: rolls baking, coffee steaming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and chicken frying slowly in the great
covered pan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It smells too good to be true,” cried Mr.
Peter, clapping his hands. “Never was there
such a Christmas supper! Come, David, boy,
we will have to scramble into some festal raiment
to do honor to Johanna’s cooking, although I
am not quite sure that I have anything to dress
up in but a pair of gold sleeve-links and a red
necktie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye might be making a prayer while ye’re
dressing that somebody will come to help eat it
up. I’ve said to Barney a score o’ times since
dinner that there’s just as much likelihood that
not a mortal soul will show his face here this
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Johanna!” David protested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, laddy. But mind, ye’ve not seen
one of them but once, yourself, and I’m a
stranger to them. Never matter; only if no
one comes ye’ll all be eating ham and fried
chicken for the rest o’ the year.” And Johanna
ended with a good-humored laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before six they were gathered in the living-room
with the candles lighted and the fire blazing
uproariously on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s all so fine and like mother used to have.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>I believe I shall be wishing somebody ‘Merry
Christmas’ before I know it,” shouted Mr.
Peter. Then he held up a warning finger.
“Hush! What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They all listened. There was certainly a
noise outside; it sounded as if some one was
feeling for the knob. David was away like a
flash to the hall and had flung open the door
wide. The next moment his voice came back
to the others, ringing with gladness:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle Joab! Oh, Uncle Joab! This is just
bully!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bent figure of the old darky stumbled in
out of the night. He carried two bundles under
his arm, each wrapped in layers of gunnysack;
and he blinked, open-mouthed, at the
lights and the faces that gathered about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It sure is a befo’-de-war Chris’mus!” he
ejaculated. Then he sniffed the air like an old
dog on a scent. “’Pon ma soul, dat’s fried
chick’n or Uncle Joab’s no sinner!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They all laughed; and one by one they shook
Uncle Joab’s hand as David introduced them.
Once divested of his outside things, the old man
turned his attention to his bundles and unwrapped
them with great care. The first turned
out to be his fiddle and he patted it lovingly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“When I fust cotch sight o’ dat yeah post
dis mo’nin’ I wa’n’t sure dat de sign was meant
fo’ no ole nigger like Uncle Joab. Den I look
’round, but dere doan’t ’pear to be nobody else.
So I brings along de ole fiddle, ’ca’se I reckon
dat dey’ll be glad to see him if dey ’ain’t got no
welcome fer me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, we’re hearty glad to see the both o’
ye.” And Barney spoke out for them all.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man beamed his gratitude as he unwrapped
his second bundle. It held a paper
sack; and Uncle Joab viewed the contents with
approval before he handed it to David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“M’lasses corn-balls; Chris’mus gif’ fo’ li’l’
boy,” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c011'>David’s thanks were cut short by the stamping
of feet outside and a clang of the knocker. Again
he flew to the door and found the eyes of the trapper
looking down upon him with grave pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nicholas Bassaraba, my friend,” he said,
proudly, and this was the way he made the
trapper known to the others.</p>

<p class='c011'>The flagman came next, the icicles hanging to
his scrubby mustache, his little blue eyes dancing
with anticipation. He was quite out of
breath and it was some minutes before he could
respond properly to his warm welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Zo, Fritz Grossman has some friends this
Chreestmas; eet es goot!” And his eyes danced
harder than ever. He felt down in the pockets
of his greatcoat and brought out his hands full
of red apples. Their glossy skins bespoke much
careful polishing. “Chreestmas apples for the
knabelein. He remembers the tale? Ja!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The stillness outside was suddenly broken by
the jingle of bells—sleigh-bells coming nearer
and nearer. This time it was Mr. Peter who
reached the door first; he had taken down the
hall lantern and was holding it high above his
head as he peered out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whoa, there!” came a voice from the dark.
“That you, Mr. Peter? I ca’late I wouldn’t
ha’ broken through no road like this for no one
else. But here we be, all hunky-dory!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I ca’late there isn’t another man who
could have done it. You bring in the lad and
I’ll see to the lady.” And Mr. Peter went out
into the darkness, lantern in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment David knew his cup of
happiness had filled to the brim; for in strode
the village stage-driver with Alfredo in his arms,
while behind them came Mr. Peter supporting
the mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s splendid! It’s perfectly splendid!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>David said over and over again, as he helped to
unbundle the South-Americans and make the
sick boy comfortable in the great lounging-chair
by the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is wonderful,” said the mother, softly.
“To have the aloneness and heart-hunger and
then to find the friend!” And her arm slipped
about David’s shoulders in a way his own
mother had.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Supper’s ready,” called Johanna from the
kitchen. “And, Barney, suppose ye and Mr.
Peter fetch out the lad, just as he is in his big
chair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They put Alfredo at one end of the table,
while Johanna sat at the other behind the great,
steaming coffee-pot. Uncle Joab insisted on
serving every one, bustling back and forth from
the stove to the kitchen, his black face radiating
his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lordy gracious!” he would burst forth every
few minutes. “Dis yeah nigger hasn’t served
a supper like dis not since he was back in ole
Virginy. Jes’ smell dat fried chicken! Humm!”
And they could not persuade him to take his
place among them until every one else’s plate
was full.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a supper it was! The men who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>been shifting for themselves alone in their cabins
or huts, the South-Americans who had been
living on food put up in cans and tins, were
quite sure they had never tasted such a Christmas
feast. And every one had stories to tell,
memories of his own homeland which brought
a flush to his cheeks and a sparkling moisture
to his eyes. Only David was silent, his ears
too full of what he was hearing, his heart too
full of what he was feeling, yes, and maybe his
mouth too full of Christmas cheer for him to
talk.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not until the last crumb of the Christmas
cake had been eaten and the last drop of
coffee been drained by Uncle Joab and they had
gathered about the fire once more, that David
spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“First, let’s have Uncle Joab play some of
his jigs and sing with his fiddle just as I heard
him that day at the camp. Then let’s have
Johanna tell us a story. She’s the only one
who hasn’t told a Christmas story.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So of course David had his wish. Uncle
Joab tuned up and played all the rollicking
airs he knew, following them with the old
plantation songs so dear to the hearts of even
those who have only sojourned in the South.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>And when he was tired and insisted that “de
ole fiddle must rest” Johanna drew her chair
closer to the hearth and began the story of
St. Bridget.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Ireland St. Bridget is sometimes called
“St. Bridhe of the Mantle,” and that is because
the people of the hills would not be forgetting
the way she came to be at Bethlehem when Our
Lord was born, or the rest of the miracle.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was to the little island of Iona that she
came when she was naught but a child, and
her coming there was strange. Her father was
Doughall Donn, a prince of Ireland; but because
of a sin, which he swore was not his, he
was banished from his Green Isle. He took
the child and left at night in a small boat; and
the winds blew and the waves carried them toward
Alba. But when they were still a long way
off the winds blew into a storm and the waves
reared themselves into a tempest and the boat
was dashed upon the rocks. It was the dawn of
that day that Cathal, the arch-druid of Iona,
looked down from his holy hill where he had
been lighting the sacrificial fire to the Sun God,
for in those days it was before the Lord had
walked the earth; and he saw below him on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>beach the figure of a man washed up by the
storm and lying as if dead. He hurried to the
place and found not only the man, but a wee
girl child, and she beside him, playing with the
shells and digging her pink toes into the wet
sand. The man was not dead, only stupid
with the sea-water; and Cathal brought them
both to a herdsman’s hut and saw that they
were fed and cared for.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night he had a strange vision concerning
the child; he dreamed that spirits from heaven
descended to watch over her while she slept;
and when he was for knowing why they should
guard her with celestial care they made this
answer:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Know ye, she is holy and blest above all
maidens. For some day it shall come to pass
that she shall cradle the King of Love upon
her breast and guard the Lord of Creation
while He sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the vision broke it was Cathal himself
that came and watched beside the herdsman’s
hut where the child slept. So Doughall
Donn was made welcome in Iona for the sake of
the child; and the druids gave him a hut and
herd of his own and saw to it that neither he
nor the child should want for anything.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>It was midsummer and the day of Bridget’s
birth, marking the twenty-first year; and at
ring o’ day while the dew still clung to the grass
Bridget left her father’s hut and climbed the
holy hill. Of all the dwellers on Iona she alone
was let watch the lighting of the sacrificial fire
and she alone was let hear the chanting of the
druid’s hymn to the Sun God. This day she
was clad in white with a wreath of the rowan
berries on her hair and a girdle of them about
her waist; and she looked fair as the flowers of
the dawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she climbed the hill the wild creatures
came running to her for a caress and the birds
hovered above her head or perched on her
shoulder. She listened to the chanting of the
hymn; she bided till the flames of the fire met
and mingled with the shafts of the sun. Then
a white bird called from the thicket and she
followed. She followed him over the crest of
the hill; and behold! when she came out to the
other slope, ’twas another country she was
seeing!</p>

<p class='c011'>Here were no longer the green fields and the
pastures filled with sheep, or the sea lying
beyond. It was a country of sand and hot sun;
and the trees and the houses about her were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>strange. She found herself standing by a well
with a strangely fashioned jug in her hand, and
her father beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bridhe,” said he, “ye are a strange lass.
Are ye not knowing that the well has not held
a drop of water for a fortnight, and did ye
think to fill your pitcher now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not remembering.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father drew her away toward the village
that lay beneath them, the village of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bridhe,” said he again, “the drouth has
been upon us these many months. The wells
are empty, even the wine is failing, and the
creatures are dying on our hands. I shall leave
the inn this night in your care while I take the
camels and the water-skins and ride for succor.
There is a well, they tell me, in a place they
call the Mount of Olives which is never dry;
and ’tis a three days’ journey or more there and
back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what is it that I should be doing, with
ye away?” asked Bridget.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had reached the door of the inn by now,
and Doughall Donn opened it for her to pass
through.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye are to stay here, birdeen, and keep the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>door barred against my return. Not a soul is
to pass over the threshold while I am gone. Ye
are not to open to the knock of man, woman, or
child—mind that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, father, what if some one should come
in mortal need—famished with the hunger or
faint with the thirst?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He led her to the rude cupboard and pointed
to the nearly empty shelves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a cruiskeen of ale and a cup o’
water, a handful o’ dry dates and some oaten
cake; that is all of food or drink left in the inn.
’Twill no more than last ye till I return, and
if ye fed another ye would starve. So mind the
promise I put on ye this night. Ye are to
shelter no one in the inn while I am gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bridget watched her father drive the camels
out of the courtyard; she barred the door on
his going and for two days no foot crossed the
threshold of the inn. But on the night of the
third day, as Bridget was making ready for bed,
she heard the sound of knocking on the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is it and what is it ye are wanting this
night?” called Bridget from within, keeping the
door fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God’s blessing on this house!” came in a
man’s voice out of the dark. “I am Joseph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>a carpenter of Arimathea, and this is Mary
who is after needing a woman’s help this night.
She is spent and can go no farther. Will ye
give us shelter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I cannot. The promise is laid on me
to give neither food nor shelter to living soul
till my father comes hither. Were it not for
that ’tis a glad welcome I’d be giving the both
of ye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then a woman’s voice came out of the
darkness, a voice that set her breasts to be
trembling and her heart to be leaping with joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are ye forgetting me, Bridhe astore?” said
the voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bridget opened the grating in the door and
looked out. There she saw a great-shouldered
giant of a man, covered with beard, and beside
him was a wee gray donkey, and on the donkey
rode a woman, who turned her face to Bridget
and smiled. And the wonder of that smile
drew Bridget’s hand to the latch.</p>

<p class='c011'>She opened the door wide and bade them
enter. She laid before them what ale and dates
and oaten cake was left, and watched them eat
in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she beckoned them to the courtyard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yonder is the byre clean with fresh straw;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and the creatures are gentle. Half the promise
have I broken this night; I have given ye food.
But shelter ye must take outside the inn.
Come!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She led the way to the byre and left them
there, hurrying back to bar the door of the inn
again. But as she was fastening the latch she
heard the sound of much travel abroad, and
looking out she saw it was her father’s camels
returning. There was great gladness in her
welcome—aye, and there was sadness for the
breaking of the promise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See,” said she, drawing her father in. “I
gave them food—only food. They are resting
in the byre.” But when she went to gather up
the dish that had been empty, behold it was
filled with dates and oaken cake! And the
cruiskeen was filled with ale!</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis a miracle!” said Bridget, the breath
leaving her; and even as she spoke the strange
thing happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside came the sound of falling rain, not
gentle as a passing shower, but the steady beat,
beat, beat of the rainy season.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The drouth is broken,” said Doughall
Donn, adding, with wonder in his voice: “What
manner of folk are those yonder? Are ye not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>minding the prophesy: ‘The King of Love,
Ruler of the World and All Time, shall be born
on the first night of rain following the great
drouth; and He shall be born in a byre outside
an inn.’ Come, let us see!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew Bridget with him across the courtyard,
but before ever they entered the byre
they saw the holy light and heard singing that
was not of this earth. And when they came
inside there was Mary upon the hay, and beside
her lay a new-born child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aigh! the blessed wee one!” whispered
Bridget, kneeling down beside them. “I am
thinking ye had better rest, Mary astore; give
me the birdeen to nurse while ye sleep.” And
with hunger-arms she reached out for the
Holy Child and wrapped it in the white mantle
that she wore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, take Him,” said Mary. “I would I
might, in the years to come, give my babe to
every barren breast. But ye, Bridget, are
alone blest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And through the long night Bridget cradled
the Child while Mary slept and the kine looked
on, kneeling in their stalls. And when day
broke, Bridget closed her eyes and slept, too,
for the weariness was upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>It was the call of a white bird that wakened
her. She started up with a cry of fear and her
arms reached over her breast for the Child, but
the Child was gone. And when she looked
about her she saw she was standing on the
crest of the holy hill, while beyond her lay
green fields and pastures full of sheep, and her
father’s hut, and the blue bay of Iona at her
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis all a dream,” she said, the wonder on
her. And then she looked at the mantle she
wore. It was woven with golden threads into
marvelous pictures of birds and beasts and
angels. And Bridget went slowly down the
holy hill, the mantle about her; and when she
came to her father’s hut she found she had been
gone for a year and six months.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>X<br /> <span class='large'>THE CHAPTER AFTER THE END</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The last thing David remembered that
night was hearing Mr. Peter’s voice
booming out a “Merry Christmas” to each of
the departing guests. Incredible and humiliating
as it might seem, Johanna had had to help
him to bed! He was so worn out with the work
and the joy of all that had happened that day
that his eyes would not stay open long enough
for him to make the proper going-to-bed arrangements
for himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the first thing David thought about when
he woke Christmas morning was the locked-out
fairy. Yes, even before he thought about the
gift that was coming that day from father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where was the fairy? He had not seen him
for two days, had not come upon a single track
that might have been his in all his tramping
through the woods for greens. He did not like
to think it, but perhaps the fairy was shivering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and hungry in some hollow tree or deserted
rabbit-burrow, homesick and alone, while he,
David, had almost, yes, had almost unlocked
the door that led back into his old world—almost
found opening-time.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not seem fair that now the fairy should
be left out, when his own happiness was the
fairy’s doing, after all; when he would never
have found the way to Christmas or the way
out of loneliness if the fairy had not made the
trail for him to follow. He made up his mind
at once, even before he was out of bed, that he
would spend Christmas day hunting for the
fairy and seeing to it that he had all the comforts
that mere mortals could supply.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he remembered the Christmas gift that
was coming. Perhaps it was something he
could share with the fairy. He had thought
about it a good many times in the days since
father’s letter had come; and he had speculated
a good deal as to what it could be. It might be
some strange curiosity from the East—father
was tremendously interested in curiosities; or
it might be books, as father was fond of books.
Of one thing he was certain, it would be something
that father would like himself; he could
not imagine father choosing anything else.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Breakfast was late. They had seen Christmas
day in before the last guest had gone the
night before; and when there are no stockings
to empty, no presents to unwrap, there is no
need to hurry breakfast along or speed the day.
Everybody was in rare good humor. Mr. Peter
swung David to his shoulder and marched
three times round the table, singing, “Good
King Wencelas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Faith, ’tis the best keeping of Christmas I
have seen since I came to this country,” was
Barney’s comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think ’tis the best I ever had,” said
Johanna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what I’m going to do,” shouted Mr.
Peter. “I’m going to steal the chart and take
it back with me to the city; and next year when
the notion begins to take me that I want to
dodge Christmas again I’ll unroll the chart, take
a good look at it, and make straight for the
right road. And I tell you what!” He put
two hands on David’s shoulders. “I believe
it would be just as well to have you along, young
man. With you there, and Barney and Johanna,
I couldn’t go wrong, you know; and
we could take a lot of other poor, tired mortals
on the road with us and show them such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Christmas as would warm their hearts and keep
their memories green for the rest of their lives.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, that’s true,” agreed Johanna. “But
if ye don’t sit down and stop talking, Mr.
Peter, ye’ll be taking the road to a cold breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were not half through when a knocking
came at the front door. Barney answered it,
and came back in a moment with a puzzled
smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis your friend, the trapper,” he said to
David. “He’ll not come in; but he wants to
be speaking with ye, laddy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Wondering much what it could mean, David
slipped from his chair and went into the hall.
The trapper was standing just inside the door,
and he was holding something small and gray
in his great fur mitten.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nicholas Bassaraba has brought you something.
It was there this morning, hanging on a
peg in the woodshed. See!” He held up the
coat of a gray squirrel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where—How did it get there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The trapper shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—how should I know? But I can guess.
And you? Where are your wits, your fancy,
my friend?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>David took the skin between his hands,
rubbing his fingers through the soft fur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You think he brought it back? That he—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it not possible? He has gone back to his
country—his people. He is no longer what you
call ‘locked out.’ So he gives back again what
he borrowed from Nicholas Bassaraba—the
coat. Ah, he is a fairy of honor; and I bring
it to you, my friend. It may be that is what
the manikin intends when he hangs it on the
peg. At any rate, it is yours to keep always;
a symbol, a memory of how you found the way
to the cabins and the hearts of some lonely men.
Yes, this you shall keep; while we keep other
memories. It is well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned toward the door to be gone, but
David held him back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it isn’t just memories, you know. I’m
coming back again and again to hear more
stories of the gipsies. And in the spring,
Barney says, perhaps you’ll help me find a
den of young foxes or raccoons. I’ve always
wanted to have some to tame.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The trapper smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even so. We will go together. It is not
hard to find the litters of young things in the
spring; they are very plentiful.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>After the trapper had gone David stood a
minute thinking before he went back to his
breakfast. So this was a white winter. And
Johanna had said that about as often as a
white winter the fairy raths opened on Christmas
Eve—just for that night. Somehow the
fairy must have known this would happen; and
he had gone back to Ireland, back to his rath,
a locked-out fairy no longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a broad smile of happiness on
David’s face as he took his seat at the table
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye certainly look pleased with your present,”
teased Barney. “What did he bring ye
now—just a squirrel’s skin?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not just! Wait until to-night and I’ll
tell you and Johanna one of your own Irish
stories. Only this one will have American improvements.”
And David nodded his head
mysteriously after Johanna’s own fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was then that the telephone rang and
Barney answered it. If there had been a
puzzled smile on his face before, when the
trapper came, there was a veritable labyrinth
of expressions now as he came back to the
kitchen. There was a tangle of mystery, astonishment,
delight, incredulity, and excitement;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and even Johanna herself could not guess
what lay at the heart of it all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak up, Barney, man,” she cried. “What
has happened ye?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Peter slapped him on the back and
thundered at him: “Wake up, sir! You look
as if you’d been dreaming about fairies!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe I have,” chuckled Barney; then he
sobered. “No, ’twas the station-agent that
’phoned. He says the wee lad’s Christmas
present has come from across the water, and
he’s sending it up this minute by the stage-driver.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it as large as that?” gasped David in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, it’s a good size.” And Barney chuckled
harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Johanna looked at him sharply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Faith, I’m believing ye know what the wee
laddy’s getting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe I do, but I’m not going to be telling
one of ye—not till it gets here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a very excited group that gathered in
the window nook and waited for the stage-driver
to make the trip up to the hilltop. It
would take some time, they knew, for the
going was slow, as he had reported the night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>before, and they all waited with a reasonable
amount of patience. All but Barney. He
strode up and down the living-room, slapping
his knees and chuckling to himself as
if he were bursting with the rarest, biggest
piece of news a man ever had to keep to
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the love of St. Patrick, can’t ye sit down
and keep quiet a minute, man?” Johanna asked
in desperation. “By the way ye are acting
ye’ll have the lad thinking his father’s sent him
a live elephant or some one o’ those creatures
that run wild in the East.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a final triumphant whoop Barney sprang
to the door and threw it open.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis almost here!” he cried. “I can hear
the bells on the sleigh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So can I,” cried David. “And there’s the
team and the sleigh and—Why, there’s somebody
in it besides the driver!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was off from the window-seat and beside
Barney at the door, and the others followed
quickly, as the driver touched the team with
his whip and the sleigh flew into plain view.
Yes, there certainly was some one on the seat
with the driver!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mercy on us!” gasped Johanna.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“Merry Christmas!” shouted Barney and
Mr. Peter together.</p>

<p class='c011'>But David could not shout. He could only
keep whispering to himself, over and over:
“Mother! <i>It’s mother!</i>”</p>
